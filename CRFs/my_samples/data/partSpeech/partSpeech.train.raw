 The  Arizona  Corporations  Commission  authorized  an  11.5  %  rate  increase  at  Tucson  Electric  Power  Co.  ,  substantially  lower  than  recommended  last  month  by  a  commission  hearing  officer  and  barely  half  the  rise  sought  by  the  utility  . 
 The  ruling  follows  a  host  of  problems  at  Tucson  Electric  ,  including  major  write-downs  ,  a  60  %  slash  in  the  common  stock  dividend  and  the  departure  of  former  Chairman  Einar  Greve  during  a  company  investigation  of  his  stock  sales  . 
 The  Arizona  regulatory  ruling  calls  for  $  42  million  in  added  revenue  yearly  ,  compared  with  a  $  57  million  boost  proposed  by  the  commission  hearing  officer  .  The  company  had  sought  increases  totaling  $  80.3  million  ,  or  22  %  . 
 The  decision  was  announced  after  trading  ended  .  Tucson  Electric  closed  at  $  20.875  a  share  ,  down  25  cents  ,  in  New  York  Stock  Exchange  composite  trading  . 
 A  Tucson  Electric  spokesman  said  the  utility  was  disappointed  by  the  commission  's  decision  and  ``  concerned  about  the  financial  integrity  of  the  company  .  '' 

 South  Korean  President  Roh  Tae  Woo  ,  brushing  aside  suggestions  that  the  won  be  revalued  again  ,  said  the  currency  's  current  level  against  the  dollar  is  ``  appropriate  .  '' 
 His  comments  ,  made  in  response  to  reporters  '  questions  at  the  National  Press  Club  here  ,  signaled  that  Seoul  is  resisting  U.S.  pressure  for  a  further  rise  in  the  currency  's  value  .  The  U.S.  wants  a  higher  won  to  make  South  Korea  's  exports  more  expensive  and  help  trim  Seoul  's  trade  surplus  .  Many  South  Korean  business  people  want  a  devaluation  instead  ,  arguing  that  the  won  's  recent  gains  already  have  weakened  the  country  's  export  performance  . 
 Mr.  Roh  also  said  South  Korea  is  taking  steps  that  would  free  the  won  to  respond  to  market  forces  .  Seoul  has  pointed  to  its  lack  of  a  foreign  exchange  market  as  one  reason  the  won  's  value  remains  heavily  controlled  . 
 Mr.  Roh  said  a  U.S.  demand  for  the  removal  of  South  Korean  import  quotas  on  beef  will  be  resolved  ``  satisfactorily  ''  but  gave  no  hint  when  that  will  happen  .  Speaking  to  a  joint  meeting  of  Congress  earlier  ,  he  said  South  Korea  ca  n't  move  quickly  on  such  agricultural  trade  issues  ``  without  causing  political  and  social  trauma  .  '' 

 Great  American  Bank  said  its  board  approved  the  formation  of  a  holding  company  enabling  the  savings  bank  to  pursue  nontraditional  banking  activities  under  a  new  federal  law  . 
 The  proposed  holding  company  's  primary  purpose  would  be  to  allow  Great  American  to  continue  engaging  in  real  estate  development  activities  ,  it  said  .  Those  activities  generated  $  26.1  million  in  operating  profit  last  year  . 
 But  according  to  Great  American  ,  such  profits  do  n't  count  toward  meeting  the  San  Diego  savings  bank  's  new  capitalization  requirements  under  1989  federal  law  .  The  new  real  estate  unit  would  have  a  separate  capital  structure  to  comply  with  the  law  . 
 The  proposed  holding  company  would  also  consolidate  Great  American  Bank  in  San  Diego  and  its  Tucson  ,  Ariz.  ,  savings  bank  into  a  single  ,  federally  chartered  institution  in  San  Diego  .  The  consolidation  is  expected  to  save  $  1  million  a  year  in  administrative  costs  ,  a  Great  American  spokesman  said  . 
 Dale  Lang  ,  who  this  week  completed  the  acquisition  of  the  publisher  of  Ms.  and  Sassy  ,  is  candid  about  the  challenge  he  is  taking  on  . 
 Mr.  Lang  admits  that  Ms.  is  ``  in  dire  straits  ''  and  that  Sassy  needs  big  promotional  dollars  to  keep  it  alive  .  But  the  57-year-old  publisher  has  moved  quickly  and  boldly  to  deal  with  the  magazines  '  problems  . 
 Last  Friday  ,  he  told  the  staff  of  Ms.  that  the  magazine  in  January  would  begin  publishing  without  advertising  .  Mr.  Lang  will  do  away  with  expensive  circulation  drives  ,  not  to  mention  sales  staff  ,  and  attempt  to  publish  the  17-year-old  magazine  supported  by  circulation  revenue  alone  . 
 ``  Any  fool  can  publish  a  money-losing  magazine  .  I  want  to  publish  one  that  succeeds  ,  ''  said  Mr.  Lang  .  ``  For  Ms.  ,  it  's  time  to  publish  for  the  reader  ,  not  the  advertiser  .  '' 
 As  for  Sassy  ,  which  competes  directly  with  News  Corp.  's  Seventeen  magazine  ,  Mr.  Lang  says  that  in  the  next  two  years  he  will  spend  $  6  million  promoting  and  improving  the  magazine  . 
 Though  Sassy  has  grown  quickly  since  its  debut  in  March  1988  ,  it  has  been  the  target  of  conservative  lobbyists  and  skittish  advertisers  who  bristled  at  its  frank  editorial  matter  on  teen-age  problems  . 
 Mr.  Lang  said  the  former  Australian  owners  of  Sassy  were  ``  blind-sided  by  the  Moral  Majority  ...  .  Their  reaction  was  to  do  nothing  and  ride  it  out  .  ''  He  said  Sassy  will  keep  its  irreverent  tone  ,  but  added  ,  ``  We  will  keep  a  close  watch  on  the  editorial  content  of  the  magazine  .  '' 
 Sassy  already  has  recovered  ;  circulation  has  quickly  passed  the  500,000  mark  and  advertising  pages  have  stabilized  this  year  at  more  than  300  .  What  's  more  ,  Mr.  Lang  says  he  has  what  all  publishers  wish  for  :  a  bona  fide  niche  .  ``  Seventeen  is  written  more  for  mothers  ,  not  their  daughters  ,  ''  said  Mr.  Lang  .  ``  But  Sassy  has  a  different  spirit  .  It  gets  more  mail  in  a  month  than  McCall  's  got  in  a  year  ,  and  it  's  not  from  mothers  .  I  feel  about  Sassy  like  I  did  about  Working  Woman  10  years  ago  .  ''  Mr.  Lang  took  on  Ms.  and  Sassy  with  the  acquisition  of  Matilda  Publications  Inc.  by  his  newly  formed  Lang  Communications  .  Lang  owns  70  %  of  Matilda  ,  while  Citicorp  owns  the  rest  through  its  Citicorp  Venture  Capital  Partners  .  Two  weeks  ago  ,  Citicorp  and  Mr.  Lang  pumped  $  800,000  into  Matilda  just  to  keep  the  doors  open  . 
 Industry  observers  have  congratulated  Mr.  Lang  on  what  some  call  his  ``  courageous  ''  handling  of  Ms.  ,  but  his  track  record  in  magazine  publishing  in  general  has  gotten  mixed  reviews  . 
 Besides  Ms.  and  Sassy  ,  closely  held  Lang  Communications  includes  Success  ,  a  magazine  for  entrepreneurs  and  small  businesses  ,  and  Working  Woman  and  Working  Mother  ,  two  monthly  magazines  .  Working  Woman  ,  with  circulation  near  one  million  ,  and  Working  Mother  ,  with  625,000  circulation  ,  are  legitimate  magazine  success  stories  .  The  magazine  Success  ,  however  ,  was  for  years  lackluster  and  unfocused  .  Only  recently  has  it  been  attractively  redesigned  and  its  editorial  product  improved  .  Success  is  expected  to  gain  at  least  because  of  the  recent  folding  of  rival  Venture  ,  another  magazine  for  growing  companies  . 
 Working  Woman  and  Working  Mother  have  operated  as  part  of  Working  Woman\  's  Group  ,  a  less-than-successful  joint  venture  between  Mr.  Lang  and  Time  Warner  Inc  .  The  joint  venture  is  being  undone  ,  with  McCall  's  magazine  being  sold  last  summer  to  the  New  York  Times  Co.  's  Magazine  Group  for  about  $  80  million  ,  and  Time  Warner  agreeing  to  sell  back  its  50  %  interest  in  Working  Woman  and  Working  Mother  to  Mr.  Lang  . 
 Executives  at  Time  Inc  .  Magazine  Co.  ,  a  subsidiary  of  Time  Warner  ,  have  said  the  joint  venture  with  Mr.  Lang  was  n't  a  good  one  .  The  venture  ,  formed  in  1986  ,  was  supposed  to  be  Time  's  low-cost  ,  safe  entry  into  women  's  magazines  .  Mr.  Lang  surprised  Time  soon  after  joining  forces  when  he  said  he  would  negotiate  rates  individually  with  advertisers  ,  a  practice  common  in  broadcasting  but  considered  taboo  by  magazine  publishers  . 
 In  addition  ,  McCall  's  put  in  a  less  than  stellar  performance  .  Until  a  recent  comeback  ,  it  saw  steep  losses  in  ad  pages  and  circulation  .  Time  executives  complained  about  the  shoddy  editorial  quality  ,  and  in  the  end  ,  one  Time  executive  who  asked  not  to  be  identified  said  ,  ``  Frankly  ,  McCall  's  and  the  joint  venture  were  an  embarrassment  .  '' 
 Mr.  Lang  feels  that  Time  's  priorities  changed  .  ``  Their  management  changed  right  after  {  the  venture  was  formed  }  ,  and  I  do  n't  think  they  were  comfortable  getting  into  the  competitive  wars  of  women  's  service  magazines  .  '' 
 Today  ,  Mr.  Lang  believes  his  magazines  will  offer  what  many  women  's  magazines  do  n't  .  ``  We  write  straight  for  women  on  their  level  ,  ''  he  said  .  ``  We  do  n't  have  passive  readers  .  ''  Mr.  Lang  points  out  that  even  Success  ,  in  part  ,  fits  the  company  's  image  ,  since  about  30  %  of  its  readership  is  female  . 
 Mr.  Lang  has  named  Carol  Taber  ,  43  ,  as  group  publisher  of  New  York-based  Lang  Communications  .  She  will  oversee  Working  Woman  ,  Working  Mother  and  Success  magazines  ,  and  retain  her  post  as  publisher  of  Working  Woman  . 
 The  sale  price  of  McCall  's  --  twice  what  Mr.  Lang  originally  paid  for  it  --  will  finance  Lang  Communications  '  buy-back  of  Time  Warner  's  50  %  interest  in  Working  Woman  and  Working  Mother  .  Mr.  Lang  says  he  is  n't  scouting  new  acquisitions  ,  at  least  for  now  .  ``  We  would  have  to  go  outside  to  banks  to  get  the  money  and  I  am  not  ready  to  do  that  ,  ''  he  said  .  ``  Besides  ,  we  have  enough  on  our  plate  .  There  is  plenty  of  work  to  be  done  on  what  we  have  .  '' 

 Britain  's  Monopolies  and  Mergers  Commission  Wednesday  cleared  Rhone-Poulenc  S.A.  's  purchase  of  a  specialty  bulk-chemical  unit  from  Monsanto  Co.  ,  saying  the  purchase  was  unlikely  to  have  any  lasting  impact  on  U.K.  industrial  consumers  . 
 The  commission  ,  which  was  asked  to  study  the  deal  by  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  after  its  announcement  in  February  ,  said  the  diversity  of  global  supply  of  chemicals  used  in  making  analgesic  drugs  was  great  enough  to  offset  the  dominant  U.K.  market  share  Rhone-Poulenc  would  gain  through  the  acquisition  . 
 The  French  chemical  giant  would  hold  an  80  %  share  of  the  U.K.  market  for  salicylic  acid  ,  methyl  salicylate  and  bulk  aspirin  . 
 The  commission  found  that  if  the  British  government  attempted  to  block  the  merger  ,  Rhone-Poulenc  would  likely  respond  by  closing  the  salicylates  plant  Monsanto  operates  in  Wales  ,  removing  the  matter  from  U.K.  jurisdiction  . 
 Morrison  Knudsen  Corp.  posted  third-quarter  net  income  of  $  7.9  million  ,  or  69  cents  a  share  ,  continuing  a  rebound  from  steep  year-ago  losses  . 
 In  the  third  quarter  a  year-earlier  ,  the  construction  and  engineering  concern  posted  a  loss  of  $  51.2  million  ,  or  $  4.68  a  share  . 
 Revenue  in  the  latest  quarter  rose  14  %  to  $  589  million  from  $  515.1  million  . 
 In  composite  trading  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  ,  Morrison  gained  $  2.25  to  $  44.125  . 
 Morrison  said  the  engineering  and  construction  segment  performed  well  ,  with  the  mining  and  MK-Ferguson  operations  making  important  contributions  . 
 Boise  ,  Idaho-based  Morrison  had  losses  totaling  $  186  million  over  the  two  years  ended  in  December  ,  but  it  has  surged  back  to  profitability  as  a  result  of  cost-cutting  and  shedding  of  unprofitable  operations  . 
 In  the  nine  months  ,  the  company  's  net  income  was  $  21.5  million  ,  or  $  1.88  a  share  ,  compared  with  a  year-earlier  loss  of  $  97.8  million  ,  or  $  8.96  a  share  .  Revenue  rose  17  %  to  $  1.62  billion  from  $  1.39  billion  . 
 The  House  Ethics  Committee  officially  cited  Rep.  Jim  Bates  (  D.  ,  Calif  .  )  for  sexually  harassing  two  female  employees  ,  but  did  n't  recommend  formal  disciplinary  action  . 
 Rep.  Bates  said  he  accepted  the  finding  ,  but  one  of  the  victims  ,  Dorena  Bertussi  ,  denounced  the  ethics  panel  's  action  as  ``  absurd  .  '' 
 Acting  more  than  a  year  after  Ms.  Bertussi  filed  a  complaint  ,  the  panel  issued  a  ``  letter  of  reproval  ''  saying  Rep.  Bates  had  admitted  conduct  that  violated  a  House  rule  forbidding  discrimination  against  employees  on  account  of  their  sex  .  It  ordered  Rep.  Bates  to  write  letters  of  apology  to  Ms.  Bertussi  and  to  a  second  complainant  ,  Karen  Dryden  . 
 Rep.  Bates  said  he  would  write  the  letters  as  ordered  .  ``  I  accept  the  resolution  of  the  matter  by  the  Ethics  Committee  ,  ''  he  said  . 
 The  panel  also  warned  Rep.  Bates  that  any  further  violations  ``  may  result  in  a  recommendation  that  disciplinary  action  be  considered  .  ''  But  Ms.  Bertussi  asked  ,  ``  Who  in  their  right  mind  is  going  to  file  another  complaint  with  the  Ethics  Committee  ?  '' 
 Rep.  Bates  has  publicly  begged  for  forgiveness  from  voters  and  was  re-elected  with  60  %  of  the  vote  last  November  . 
 Mesa  Airlines  said  the  takeover  offer  it  received  earlier  this  week  from  StatesWest  Airlines  is  for  a  combination  of  cash  and  securities  valued  by  StatesWest  at  $  10  a  Mesa  share  .  Both  companies  are  regional  carriers  in  the  Southwest  . 
 When  it  made  the  offer  ,  StatesWest  declined  to  disclose  details  and  asked  Mesa  to  do  the  same  .  But  Farmington  ,  N.M.-based  Mesa  said  the  offer  was  for  $  7  in  cash  and  unspecified  StatesWest  securities  valued  at  $  3  a  share  .  Based  on  the  number  of  Mesa  shares  outstanding  not  already  owned  by  StatesWest  ,  the  proposed  takeover  would  have  a  value  of  about  $  15.3  million  .  StatesWest  owns  7.25  %  of  Mesa  . 
 Last  week  ,  Mesa  rejected  a  general  proposal  from  StatesWest  that  the  two  carriers  combine  .  In  response  to  the  specific  offer  ,  Gary  Risley  ,  Mesa  vice  president  ,  said  management  will  ask  directors  to  employ  a  financial  consultant  to  advise  them  . 
 Hawker  Siddeley  Group  PLC  ,  a  U.K.  engineering  company  ,  reported  a  16  %  jump  in  pretax  profit  for  the  six-month  period  ending  June  30  . 
 Pretax  profit  rose  to  #  93.2  million  (  $  146.8  million  )  from  #  80.6  million  (  $  127  million  )  ,  matching  analysts  '  expectations  ,  which  ranged  from  #  90  million  to  #  95  million  . 
 Profit  after  taxes  and  minority  interests  increased  16  %  to  #  55.2  million  from  #  47.6  million  in  the  year-earlier  period  ,  while  earnings  per  share  rose  16  %  to  27.9  pence  (  44  cents  )  from  24.1  pence  (  38  cents  )  . 
 Hawker  Siddeley  said  its  core  electrical  products  division  enjoyed  strong  growth  ,  with  a  20  %  rise  in  operating  profit  during  the  period  . 
 Fleet\  Financial  Group  reported  a  12  %  increase  in  net  income  in  the  third  quarter  ,  led  by  a  43  %  gain  in  its  financial  services  group  .  Fleet  's  net  was  $  96.4  million  ,  or  86  cents  a  primary  share  ,  compared  with  $  85.8  million  ,  or  79  cents  a  share  ,  a  year  earlier  . 
 The  Providence  ,  R.I.  ,  financial  services  group  ,  which  includes  commercial-credit  ,  leasing  and  mortgage-banking  operations  ,  contributed  $  30.6  million  to  net  ,  up  from  last  year  's  $  21.3  million  .  Fleet  also  noted  that  ,  unlike  other  banking  companies  in  the  Northeast  ,  it  has  been  only  marginally  hurt  by  nonperforming  loans  that  have  resulted  from  the  slumping  regional  real  estate  market  . 
 Fleet  reported  nine-month  net  of  $  279.0  million  ,  or  $  2.51  a  primary  share  ,  up  from  $  248.2  million  ,  or  $  2.28  a  share  ,  a  year  earlier  . 
 Benj  .  Franklin  Federal  Savings  &  Loan  Association  said  it  expects  to  post  a  third-quarter  net  loss  of  about  $  8  million  ,  or  $  1.04  a  share  ,  as  a  result  of  adding  $  11  million  in  loan-loss  reserves  . 
 The  Portland  ,  Ore.  ,  thrift  ,  which  has  $  5.2  billion  of  assets  ,  had  net  income  in  last  year  's  third  quarter  of  $  1.8  million  ,  or  23  cents  a  share  .  Franklin  said  it  expects  to  report  earnings  for  the  latest  quarter  next  week  . 
 The  additional  reserves  relate  to  possible  write-downs  of  certain  assets  held  by  Franklin  and  its  subsidiaries  and  the  default  of  a  bond  in  its  investment  portfolio  ,  the  thrift  said  .  According  to  a  spokeswoman  ,  they  also  relate  to  changes  Franklin  will  have  to  make  in  its  accounting  procedures  to  comply  with  new  federal  capitalization  requirements  for  thrifts  . 
 The  company  's  shares  closed  yesterday  at  $  4.25  ,  off  25  cents  ,  in  national  over-the-counter  trading  . 
 Arkla  Inc.  said  that  as  part  of  a  program  to  improve  profitability  it  will  take  a  total  of  $  189  million  in  after-tax  charges  by  year  end  .  It  also  announced  an  initial  public  offering  of  18  %  of  its  gas  exploration  and  production  subsidiary  . 
 The  Shreveport  ,  La.  ,  natural  gas  company  said  the  charges  ,  though  partially  offset  by  a  one-time  gain  from  the  offering  ,  will  result  in  a  full-year  after-tax  loss  .  Last  year  ,  the  company  had  net  income  of  $  117.3  million  ,  or  $  1.30  a  share  . 
 Arkla  said  it  will  report  $  179  milllion  in  one-time  charges  against  continuing  operations  for  the  third  quarter  ,  reflecting  settlement  of  certain  natural  gas  contracts  .  It  said  it  will  take  a  $  10  million  fourth-quarter  charge  against  discontinued  operations  ,  reflecting  certain  write-downs  and  the  planned  sale  of  a  unit  . 
 Arkla  said  its  initial  offering  of  18  %  of  Arkla  Exploration  Co.  is  expected  to  result  in  a  net  gain  of  about  $  90  million  ,  which  will  be  used  to  pay  down  Arkla  debt  .  Arkla  Exploration  owns  sizable  gas  and  crude-oil  reserves  in  the  South  and  Southwest  . 
 South  Africa  negotiated  a  new  debt  agreement  with  its  major  foreign  creditors  for  about  $  8  billion  of  its  foreign  debt  outstanding  ,  said  Chris  Stals  ,  governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank  and  the  country  's  chief  debt  negotiator  . 
 The  new  agreement  will  last  for  3  1\  years  starting  July  1  ,  1990  ,  when  the  current  agreement  expires  . 
 The  announcement  coincides  with  the  start  of  the  Commonwealth  Ministers  Conference  in  Kuala  Lumpur  ,  where  proposals  for  renewed  sanctions  against  South  Africa  ,  including  moves  to  block  settling  of  a  new  debt  agreement  ,  were  scheduled  to  be  discussed  . 
 As  with  the  previous  pact  ,  the  new  agreement  covers  the  country  's  debt  ``  inside  the  net  ,  ''  which  applies  mainly  to  repayments  due  to  overseas  creditor  banks  by  the  private  sector  . 
 The  agreement  calls  for  South  African  debtors  to  make  repayments  in  eight  installments  ,  starting  in  December  of  next  year  .  The  redemption  then  would  be  at  1.5  %  of  the  total  debt  ,  increasing  to  2.5  %  in  February  1991  ,  and  to  3  %  at  six-month  intervals  thereafter  .  A  revised  provision  would  be  included  for  the  conversion  of  short-term  claims  inside  the  net  to  long-term  loans  outside  the  net  .  These  claims  would  be  repayable  over  a  10-year  period  . 
 Foreign  debt  falling  outside  the  net  of  affected  indebtedness  --  which  Mr.  Stahl  estimated  at  $  12  billion  --  would  remain  not  subject  to  the  debt  arrangements  . 
 New  York  Times  Co.  said  net  income  rose  in  the  third  quarter  because  of  a  one-time  gain  on  the  sale  of  the  company  's  cable-TV  system  . 
 Net  surged  to  $  210.8  million  ,  or  $  2.68  a  share  ,  from  $  26.7  million  ,  or  33  cents  a  share  ,  a  year  earlier  .  The  latest  quarter  included  a  gain  of  $  193.3  million  ,  or  $  2.46  a  share  ,  from  the  sale  of  New  York  Times  Cable  ,  completed  in  August  . 
 Exclusive  of  the  gain  ,  operating  profit  declined  35  %  to  $  16.4  million  ,  or  21  cents  a  share  ,  from  $  25.2  million  ,  or  31  cents  a  share  .  The  decline  primarily  reflected  the  dilution  from  acquiring  McCall  's  ,  Golf  World  (  U.S.  )  and  Sailing  World  magazines  ;  lower  equity  earnings  from  the  forest-products  group  because  of  price  discounting  and  an  unfavorable  exchange  rate  ,  and  an  8.7  %  decline  in  advertising  linage  at  the  New  York  Times  ,  the  company  's  flagship  newspaper  .  Advertising  volume  at  the  company  's  35  regional  newspapers  decreased  1.1  %  .  The  company  said  the  negative  factors  are  expected  to  continue  into  next  year  . 
 Revenue  rose  6.4  %  to  $  415.3  million  from  $  390.5  million  . 
 Democrat  Gene  Taylor  won  a  special  election  to  fill  the  congressional  seat  vacated  by  the  death  of  Republican  Larkin  Smith  ,  taking  back  the  GOP  's  lone  redoubt  in  Mississippi  's  House  delegation  . 
 Mr.  Taylor  's  overwhelming  victory  against  Republican  Tom  Anderson  reclaims  a  seat  the  Republicans  had  held  for  17  years  and  gives  the  Democrats  their  fifth  victory  in  the  seven  special  House  elections  held  this  year  .  Mr.  Taylor  ,  a  36-year-old  state  senator  from  Bay  St.  Louis  ,  won  65  %  of  the  vote  in  a  district  that  has  voted  Republican  in  the  past  five  presidential  elections  and  that  was  once  represented  by  Republican  U.S.  Sen.

 The  impact  of  the  destruction  of  this  2.5-mile  stretch  of  highway  was  tragically  measured  in  lost  lives  .  But  there  are  other  long-term  effects  that  raise  serious  questions  about  the  ability  of  California  's  infrastructure  to  withstand  a  major  temblor  . 
 It  could  easily  be  two  years  before  the  well-traveled  artery  that  helps  connect  Oakland  with  San  Francisco  is  reopened  ,  and  the  cost  to  build  a  new  stretch  of  highway  could  soar  to  more  than  $  250  million  ,  said  Charles  J.  O'Connell  ,  deputy  district  director  in  Los  Angeles  of  the  California  Department  of  Transportation  ,  nicknamed  Caltrans  .  Caltrans  in  Sacramento  said  total  damage  from  the  collapsed  highway  is  estimated  at  around  $  500  million  . 
 The  aftershocks  of  the  highway  tragedy  are  reverberating  in  Los  Angeles  as  well  ,  as  local  politicians  spoke  yesterday  against  plans  to  bring  double-decking  to  Los  Angeles  freeways  by  1994  .  Caltrans  plans  to  add  a  second  deck  for  buses  and  car  pools  above  the  median  of  a  2.5-mile  stretch  of  the  Harbor  Freeway  just  south  of  Los  Angeles  ,  near  the  Memorial  Coliseum  .  Los  Angeles  County  Supervisor  Kenneth  Hahn  yesterday  vowed  to  fight  the  introduction  of  double-decking  in  the  area  . 
 Caltrans  abandoned  double-decking  in  the  early  1970s  ,  following  the  1971  Sylmar  earthquake  that  destroyed  freeway  sections  just  north  of  Los  Angeles  ,  Mr.  O'Connell  explained  .  That  temblor  measured  6.1  on  the  Richter  scale  ;  Tuesday  's  was 
 So  why  even  consider  stacking  freeways  now  ?  ``  We  've  run  out  of  places  to  build  freeways  in  L.A.  ,  and  the  only  place  to  go  is  up  ,  ''  Mr.  O'Connell  said  ,  although  he  acknowledges  there  are  many  obstacles  ,  including  cost  .  But  as  for  safety  ,  he  says  double-deck  freeways  built  today  with  the  heavily  reinforced  concrete  and  thicker  columns  required  after  the  Sylmar  quake  should  withstand  a  calamitous  temblor  of  7.5  to  8  on  the  Richter  scale  . 
 Reasons  for  the  collapse  of  the  Nimitz  Freeway  were  sketchy  yesterday  .  But  most  structural  engineers  attributed  the  destruction  to  improper  reinforcement  of  the  columns  that  supported  the  decks  ,  and  the  fact  that  the  ground  beneath  the  highway  is  largely  landfill  and  can  become  unstable  ,  or  ``  liquefy  ,  ''  in  a  major  quake  . 
 The  two-story  roadway  ,  designed  in  the  mid-1940s  and  completed  in  1957  ,  was  supported  by  columns  that  apparently  lacked  the  kind  of  steel  reinforcement  used  in  highways  today  .  While  the  pillars  did  have  long  metal  bars  running  vertically  through  them  for  reinforcement  ,  they  apparently  lacked  an  adequate  number  of  metal  ``  ties  ''  that  run  horizontally  through  the  column  ,  said  Leo  Parker  ,  a  structural  engineer  in  Los  Angeles  .  Caltrans  today  uses  a  variation  of  the  design  Mr.  Parker  describes  ,  with  spiraling  steel  rods  inside  . 
 But  in  the  case  of  the  Nimitz  Freeway  ,  the  lack  of  such  support  caused  the  core  of  the  columns  to  crumble  and  buckle  under  the  weight  of  the  second  deck  ,  crushing  motorists  who  were  lined  up  in  bumper-to-bumper  rush-hour  traffic  on  the  lower  deck  nearly  15  feet  below  . 
 Officials  of  the  state  agency  did  n't  have  any  immediate  explanation  why  the  reinforcement  did  n't  hold  up  . 
 Caltrans  reinforced  the  highway  in  1977  as  part  of  a  $  55  million  statewide  project  ,  using  steel  cables  to  tie  the  decks  of  the  freeway  to  the  columns  and  prevent  the  structure  from  swaying  in  a  quake  .  Caltrans  spokesman  Jim  Drago  in  Sacramento  declined  to  identify  the  engineering  firm  that  did  the  reinforcement  work  . 
 Liability  in  the  bridge  and  road  collapses  will  revolve  around  whether  government  took  ``  reasonable  care  ''  to  build  and  maintain  the  structures  ,  says  John  Messina  ,  a  Tacoma  ,  Wash.  ,  personal-injury  attorney  who  specializes  in  highway  design  and  maintenance  cases  .  The  firm  brought  in  to  strengthen  the  structure  could  be  liable  as  well  . 
 The  results  of  the  quake  certainly  raise  questions  about  whether  reasonable  care  was  taken  ,  Mr.  Messina  says  .  Given  the  seismic  history  of  the  Bay  Area  ,  ``  it  seems  to  me  that  a  6.9  earthquake  is  a  foreseeable  event  .  '' 
 Caltrans  '  Mr.  Drago  defended  the  agency  's  work  on  the  Nimitz  Freeway  .  ``  The  work  was  done  properly  ,  ''  he  said  .  ``  Basically  ,  we  had  a  severe  earthquake  of  significant  duration  and  it  was  just  something  the  structure  could  n't  withstand  .  '' 
 Ironically  ,  Caltrans  this  year  began  working  on  a  second  round  of  seismic  reinforcements  of  freeways  around  the  state  ,  this  time  wrapping  freeway  columns  in  ``  steel  blankets  ''  to  reinforce  them  .  But  only  bridges  supported  with  single  rows  of  columns  were  top  priority  ,  and  the  Nimitz  Freeway  ,  supported  by  double  rows  ,  was  left  out  ,  Mr.  Drago  explained  .  ``  The  reason  is  that  the  technology  is  such  that  we  're  not  able  to  retrofit  multi-column  structures  ,  ''  he  said  . 
 Charles  McCoy  in  San  Francisco  and  John  R.  Emshwiller  in  Los  Angeles  contributed  to  this  article  . 
 Lionel  Corp.  's  board  unanimously  rejected  a  tender  offer  of  $  8  a  share  ,  or  $  95.4  million  ,  for  as  much  as  90  %  of  Lionel  by  a  group  with  a  9.9  %  stake  in  the  toy  retailer  . 
 Lionel  also  urged  holders  of  its  stock  and  debt  not  to  tender  their  securities  ,  saying  it  wants  to  remain  independent  to  pursue  its  business  strategy  .  Lionel  also  said  the  offer  by  Robert  I.  Toussie  Limited  Partnership  is  inadequate  ,  and  full  of  conditions  that  leave  it  ``  subject  to  substantial  uncertainty  .  '' 
 In  addition  ,  Lionel  began  a  lawsuit  in  federal  District  Court  in  New  York  seeking  to  enjoin  the  offer  ,  alleging  ,  among  other  things  ,  violations  of  federal  securities  law  and  fraudulent  manipulation  of  the  market  for  Lionel  's  securities  . 
 Robert  I.  Toussie  ,  general  partner  of  the  investment  group  ,  said  the  Lionel  response  reflected  management  's  entrenched  position  ,  saying  officials  had  failed  to  come  up  with  a  better  alternative  to  his  group  's  offer  .  Mr.  Toussie  said  he  would  respond  to  Lionel  's  suit  after  his  lawyers  review  it  . 
 Efforts  by  a  federal  mediator  to  reignite  talks  between  Boeing  Co.  and  the  Machinists  union  apparently  failed  ,  and  no  further  meetings  are  scheduled  . 
 Company  officials  and  union  representatives  did  n't  meet  face  to  face  ,  but  the  mediator  shuttled  between  the  two  groups  . 
 In  a  statement  issued  after  the  meeting  ,  the  aerospace  giant  said  it  wo  n't  increase  its  offer  although  adjustments  within  the  proposed  pay-and-benefit  mix  are  possible  .  Machinists  already  have  rejected  a  proposal  that  called  for  a  4  %  pay  increase  and  8  %  bonus  in  the  first  year  .  In  the  second  year  ,  workers  would  receive  a  3  %  wage  boost  and  a  3  %  bonus  ,  followed  by  a  3  %  increase  without  a  bonus  in  the  third  year  . 
 ``  The  company  will  not  budge  on  anything  ,  ''  said  a  spokesman  for  the  union  .  As  the  strike  enters  its  15th  day  today  ,  some  members  are  getting  nervous  ,  the  spokesman  conceded  ,  but  the  majority  of  the  55,000  Machinists  are  prepared  to  ``  wait  it  out  as  long  as  it  takes  .  '' 

 United  Merchants  &  Manufacturers  Inc.  said  its  president  ,  Uzi  Ruskin  ,  withdrew  his  proposal  to  acquire  control  of  the  New  York  textile  and  clothing  company  . 
 Last  month  ,  Mr.  Ruskin  proposed  ,  among  other  things  ,  to  buy  3.5  million  shares  ,  or  38  %  ,  for  $  4  apiece  .  Coupled  with  his  current  1.2  million  shares  and  4  %  held  by  an  associate  ,  the  stake  would  have  given  him  control  of  55  %  of  the  concern  . 
 In  a  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  filing  ,  Mr.  Ruskin  had  said  that  holders  of  the  other  45  %  of  United  Merchants  would  receive  one-half  share  of  a  new  preferred  stock  for  each  of  their  shares  . 
 A  special  committee  of  United  Merchants  directors  said  that  in  view  of  uncertainties  regarding  various  legal  and  financial  considerations  ,  it  could  n't  recommend  the  plan  to  the  full  board  . 
 The  company  is  exploring  ,  with  a  major  financial  institution  ,  the  development  of  a  plan  to  boost  the  value  of  the  company  for  its  holders  ,  Mr.  Ruskin  said  . 
 In  a  separate  SEC  filing  ,  Albert  Safer  ,  who  holds  6.46  %  of  United  Merchants  ,  said  he  retained  investment  bank  Lazard  Freres  &  Co.  for  advice  as  he  evaluates  the  possibility  of  making  a  bid  for  the  textile  maker  .  On  Friday  ,  Mr.  Safer  ,  a  Newark  ,  N.J.  ,  textile  businessman  ,  signed  a  confidentiality  agreement  under  which  United  Merchants  would  provide  him  with  nonpublic  information  . 
 The  White  House  is  making  sure  nobody  will  accuse  it  of  taking  this  crisis  lightly  . 
 In  the  aftermath  of  the  California  earthquake  ,  President  Bush  and  his  aides  flew  into  a  whirlwind  of  earthquake-related  activity  yesterday  morning  .  Some  of  it  was  necessary  to  get  federal  help  flowing  to  victims  ,  but  some  seemed  designed  mostly  to  project  an  image  of  a  White  House  in  action  . 
 Mr.  Bush  and  his  aides  were  accused  of  responding  too  slowly  after  the  Exxon  Valdez  oil  tanker  split  open  in  Alaskan  waters  and  Hurricane  Hugo  struck  the  Carolina  coast  ,  and  they  clearly  do  n't  want  a  repeat  of  those  charges  now  .  So  the  White  House  announced  that  Mr.  Bush  got  his  first  earthquake  briefing  of  the  day  at  6:30  a.m.  from  chief  of  staff  John  Sununu  . 
 By  noon  ,  Mr.  Bush  had  taken  two  phone  calls  from  Vice  President  Dan  Quayle  ,  who  was  in  California  ;  made  a  televised  statement  of  concern  ;  signed  a  disaster  proclamation  ;  received  a  written  report  from  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  ;  and  visited  FEMA  headquarters  . 
 Mr.  Bush  himself  essentially  acknowledged  that  he  and  his  aides  were  trying  to  head  off  criticism  .  On  his  FEMA  visit  ,  Mr.  Bush  said  that  he  hoped  there  would  be  ``  less  carping  ''  about  the  emergency  office  's  performance  this  time  ,  adding  that  the  agency  ``  took  a  hit  ''  for  its  reaction  to  Hurricane  Hugo  . 
 The  White  House  already  is  talking  of  Mr.  Bush  visiting  the  California  earthquake  site  this  weekend  .  He  visited  the  Hugo  devastation  but  not  until  after  local  leaders  urged  him  to  do  so  . 
 Beazer  PLC  ,  a  major  British  building  materials  and  construction  concern  ,  reported  a  24  %  jump  in  pretax  profit  for  its  latest  financial  year  ,  helped  largely  by  contributions  from  its  U.S.  unit  ,  Koppers  Co  . 
 Pretax  profit  for  the  year  to  June  30  rose  to  #  142.5  million  (  $  224.5  million  )  from  #  114.7  million  (  $  180.7  million  )  ,  broadly  matching  analysts  '  expectations  . 
 Profit  after  taxes  and  minority  interests  but  before  extraordinary  items  increased  22  %  to  #  92.6  million  from  #  75.6  million  a  year  earlier  ,  while  fully  diluted  earnings  per  share  rose  to  29.90  pence  (  47  cents  )  from  24.68  pence  (  39  cents  )  . 
 The  lethal  shudders  that  wracked  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area  --  rated  a  6.9  on  the  Richter  scale  --  did  n't  match  the  great  earthquake  of  1906  ,  rated  at  8.25  . 
 The  difference  of  just  1.35  points  on  the  scale  ,  designed  by  Charles  Richter  of  CalTech  in  the  1930s  ,  means  the  older  quake  was  ``  10  to  20  times  stronger  ,  ''  says  Lane  Johnson  ,  director  of  the  University  of  California  Berkeley  Seismographic  Station  . 
 The  ground  ruptured  along  a  20-to-30-mile  stretch  of  the  San  Andreas  Fault  on  Tuesday  ,  Mr.  Johnson  added  .  In  1906  ,  the  rupture  was  300  miles  long  and  a  couple  feet  wide  . 
 Though  the  epicenter  of  Tuesday  's  temblor  was  located  10  miles  north  of  the  town  of  Santa  Cruz  ,  and  50  miles  south  of  San  Francisco  ,  its  havoc  hopscotched  up  the  coast  in  seemingly  random  fashion  .  But  the  greatest  damage  was  visited  on  buildings  and  roadways  perched  upon  landfill  ,  as  were  the  Marina  District  of  San  Francisco  and  the  Bay  Bridge  --  two  areas  of  maximum  devastation  . 
 ``  Landfill  --  loose  and  unconsolidated  earth  --  may  feel  like  rock  but  it  behaves  like  liquid  when  you  shake  it  ,  ''  said  Douglas  Segar  ,  professor  of  geosciences  at  San  Francisco  State  University  in  a  televised  interview  .  ``  It  liquefies  in  a  patchwork  quilt  pattern  .  Our  quake  behaved  much  like  the  Mexico  City  earthquake  ,  where  great  damage  was  miles  from  the  epicenter  .  '' 
 Mr.  Johnson  ,  of  the  Berkeley  seismographic  station  ,  said  :  ``  Landfill  can  be  done  if  it  's  properly  compacted  .  You  can  drive  piles  on  it  and  build  on  it  .  ''  He  cited  the  example  of  San  Francisco  's  financial  district  ,  where  many  new  glass  towers  survived  almost  unscathed  . 
 But  the  public  policy  issues  raised  by  earthquake  damage  will  be  difficult  to  address  ,  Mr.  Johnson  predicted  . 
 ``  The  attention  span  of  the  public  is  short  ,  ''  he  said  .  ``  We  've  known  for  years  and  years  we  've  got  lots  of  old  {  pre-1950s  }  unreinforced  brick  and  masonry  buildings  .  '' 
 One  old  building  ,  the  Golden  State  Bank  Building  on  Front  Street  ,  had  its  yellow  brick  facade  sheared  off  by  the  shock  of  the  quake  ,  leaving  a  wedge  of  its  third  floor  open  to  the  air  ,  while  piles  of  dusty  bricks  tumbled  to  the  street  below  narrowly  missing  rush-hour  pedestrians  and  cars  .  Reinforcing  such  old  building  stock  ,  Mr.  Johnson  said  ,  ``  comes  down  to  money  .  It  's  a  danger  .  We  know  it  's  there  .  And  sooner  or  later  ,  we  have  to  do  something  about  it  .  '' 
 The  urgency  is  heightened  because  this  week  's  earthquake  --  while  major  and  followed  by  hundreds  of  aftershocks  --  did  n't  release  enough  pent-up  energy  tension  along  the  faultlines  to  preclude  more  and  bigger  quakes  soon  . 
 ``  The  big  one  is  still  due  ,  ''  Mr.  Johnson  predicted  in  an  interview  .  ``  The  Bay  Area  has  three  very  dangerous  faults  ,  the  San  Andreas  ,  the  Hayward  fault  and  the  Calaveras  fault  .  It  {  Tuesday  's  quake  }  has  n't  solved  our  problem  .  In  California  ,  this  is  the  reality  .  '' 

 Coca-Cola  Co.  may  be  about  to  intensify  the  cola  wars  . 
 Coke  said  it  will  test  market  a  caffeine-free  version  of  its  flagship  brand  ,  Coca-Cola  Classic  ,  beginning  next  week  in  Charlotte  ,  N.C  .  Other  ,  as  yet  unnamed  ,  cities  will  follow  .  If  all  goes  well  ,  the  product  will  be  rolled  out  for  national  sales  sometime  next  year  ,  a  Coke  spokesman  said  . 
 After  the  confusion  surrounding  the  change  of  the  Coke  formula  in  1985  ,  Coca-Cola  was  reluctant  to  clutter  the  Classic  name  with  a  brand  extension  .  But  now  ,  the  soft-drink  giant  appears  willing  to  take  the  risk  . 
 ``  The  name  Classic  Coke  has  tremendous  value  ,  and  they  have  n't  merchandised  that  name  before  ,  ''  says  Jesse  Meyers  ,  publisher  of  the  trade  journal  Beverage  Digest  . 
 The  Coke  spokesman  said  a  caffeine-free  Classic  should  help  increase  volume  of  the  original  brand  .  Indeed  ,  analysts  have  said  that  the  absence  of  new  products  ,  among  other  factors  ,  has  limited  sales  growth  throughout  the  industry  .  Coke  now  leads  Pepsi  in  market  share  in  caffeine-free  diet  colas  but  trails  Pepsi  in  sales  of  caffeine-free  sugared  colas  ,  according  to  Beverage  Digest  . 
 Coke  introduced  a  caffeine-free  sugared  cola  based  on  its  original  formula  in  1983  .  It  switched  to  a  caffeine-free  formula  using  its  new  Coke  in  1985  . 
 Coke  has  been  studying  the  possibility  of  introducing  a  caffeine-free  Classic  for  a  year  ,  a  company  spokesman  said  .  He  said  large  increases  in  sales  of  other  non-caffeine  soft  drinks  make  the  timing  right  now  . 
 CALIFORNIA  STRUGGLED  with  the  aftermath  of  a  Bay  area  earthquake  . 
 As  aftershocks  shook  the  San  Francisco  Bay  area  ,  rescuers  searched  through  rubble  for  survivors  of  Tuesday  's  temblor  ,  and  residents  picked  their  way  through  glass-strewn  streets  .  In  Oakland  ,  hopes  faded  for  finding  any  more  survivors  within  the  concrete  and  steel  from  the  collapse  of  an  interstate  highway  .  At  least  270  people  were  reported  killed  and  1,400  injured  in  the  rush-hour  tremor  that  caused  billions  of  dollars  of  damage  along  100  miles  of  the  San  Andreas  fault  .  Bush  declared  the  region  a  major  disaster  area  and  the  military  was  mobilized  to  prevent  looting  . 
 The  baseball  commissioner  said  the  third  game  of  the  World  Series  between  the  Giants  and  the  Athletics  would  be  played  Tuesday  in  Candlestick  Park  . 
 HONECKER  WAS  OUSTED  as  leader  of  East  Germany  amid  growing  unrest  . 
 The  77-year-old  official  ,  who  oversaw  the  building  of  the  Berlin  Wall  ,  was  removed  during  a  meeting  of  the  163-member  Communist  Party  Central  Committee  in  East  Berlin  .  Honecker  ,  who  was  reported  ill  following  gall-bladder  surgery  in  August  ,  said  he  was  resigning  for  health  reasons  .  He  was  succeeded  by  internal-security  chief  Egon  Krenz  ,  52  ,  a  hard-liner  who  quickly  ruled  out  any  sharing  of  power  with  pro-democracy  groups  . 
 Honecker  's  departure  came  after  weeks  of  street  protests  and  an  exodus  to  the  West  of  East  Germans  who  had  become  disenchanted  with  his  rule  . 
 HUNGARY  ADOPTED  constitutional  changes  to  form  a  democratic  system  . 
 At  a  nationally  televised  legislative  session  in  Budapest  ,  the  Parliament  overwhelmingly  approved  changes  formally  ending  one-party  domination  in  the  country  ,  regulating  free  elections  by  next  summer  and  establishing  the  office  of  state  president  to  replace  a  21-member  council  .  The  country  was  renamed  the  Republic  of  Hungary  .  Like  other  Soviet  bloc  nations  ,  it  had  been  known  as  a  ``  people  's  republic  ''  since 
 The  voting  for  new  laws  followed  dissolution  of  Hungary  's  Communist  Party  this  month  and  its  replacement  by  a  Western-style  Socialist  Party  . 
 The  space  shuttle  Atlantis  blasted  into  orbit  from  Cape  Canaveral  ,  Fla.  ,  and  its  crew  of  five  astronauts  launched  the  nuclear-powered  Galileo  space  probe  on  a  flight  to  the  planet  Jupiter  .  The  $  1.4  billion  robot  spacecraft  's  exploratory  mission  is  to  take  six  years  .  The  shuttle  is  slated  to  return  Monday  to  California  . 
 South  Korea  's  President  Roh  addressed  a  joint  House-Senate  meeting  and  urged  patience  over  U.S.  demands  for  the  opening  of  Seoul  's  markets  to  more  American  goods  ,  saying  trade  issues  would  be  ``  resolved  to  mutual  satisfaction  .  ''  He  also  said  tragic  results  could  follow  any  ``  hint  of  weakening  ''  of  the  U.S.  defense  commitment  to  Seoul  . 
 The  Census  Bureau  reported  that  13.1  %  of  the  U.S.  population  ,  or  31.9  million  people  ,  were  living  in  poverty  in  1988  .  Last  year  's  figure  was  down  from  13.4  %  in  1987  and  marked  the  fifth  consecutive  annual  decline  in  the  poverty  rate  .  Per  capita  income  rose  1.7  %  to  $  13,120  ,  but  median  family  income  fell  0.2  %  . 
 The  Bush  administration  accused  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Shamir  of  hindering  peace  efforts  in  the  Mideast  with  ``  unhelpful  ''  and  disappointing  statements  .  Shamir  said  Tuesday  that  he  was  prepared  to  risk  a  policy  conflict  with  the  U.S.  over  an  Egyptian  plan  to  hold  direct  Israeli-Palestinian  talks  ,  which  the  premier  's  Likud  bloc  opposes  . 
 Cuba  was  elected  to  the  U.N.  Security  Council  for  the  first  time  since  its  Castro-led  revolution  30  years  ago  .  The  election  was  by  secret  ballot  in  the  General  Assembly  .  The  U.S.  did  n't  openly  oppose  Cuba  's  seating  as  the  Latin  American  council  delegate  . 
 Britain  's  Prime  Minister  Thatcher  told  a  Commonwealth  summit  in  Kuala  Lumpur  ,  Malaysia  ,  that  sanctions  against  South  Africa  were  ``  utterly  irresponsible  ,  ''  officials  said  .  But  other  nations  at  the  opening  of  the  49-nation  meeting  of  Britain  and  its  former  colonies  pressed  for  continued  or  stronger  embargoes  in  an  effort  to  end  apartheid  . 
 Arab  officials  in  Saudi  Arabia  said  three-week-old  talks  by  Lebanese  lawmakers  aimed  at  ending  Lebanon  's  civil  war  appeared  about  to  collapse  .  Christian  legislators  are  insisting  on  a  Syrian  troop  pullout  from  Lebanon  before  agreeing  to  political  changes  giving  the  nation  's  Moslems  a  greater  role  in  Beirut  's  government  . 
 Colombia  's  judges  launched  a  72-hour  strike  to  press  security  demands  following  Tuesday  's  murder  of  a  High  Court  justice  in  Medellin  .  The  country  's  narcotics  traffickers  claimed  responsibility  for  the  slaying  .  Most  of  the  country  's  20,000  judges  and  judicial  employees  joined  the  work  stoppage  . 
 Charles  S.  Mitchell  ,  a  vice  president  with  Homart  Development  Co.  ,  the  real  estate  development  subsidiary  of  Sears  ,  Roebuck  &  Co.  ,  was  named  president  of  Figgie  Properties  ,  a  real  estate  development  unit  .  He  succeeds  William  Kohut  ,  who  resigned  earlier  this  year  .  Also  ,  Richard  A.  Barkley  ,  a  former  marketing  executive  with  FMC  Corp.  ,  was  appointed  president  of  Continental  Container  Systems  ,  a  producer  of  can  closing  machinery  that  Figgie  acquired  late  last  year  .  Figgie  is  a  fire  protection  ,  electronics  and  industrial  products  concern  . 
 Dow  Chemical  Co.  said  third-quarter  net  income  slipped  6.8  %  from  a  record  year-ago  quarter  .  The  decline  broke  a  streak  of  10  quarters  in  which  Dow  posted  earnings  increases  . 
 Dow  's  third-quarter  net  fell  to  $  589  million  ,  or  $  3.29  a  share  ,  from  $  632  million  ,  or  $  3.36  a  share  ,  a  year  ago  .  Sales  in  the  latest  quarter  rose  2  %  to  $  4.25  billion  from  $  4.15  billion  a  year  earlier  . 
 Dow  closed  at  $  94.625  a  share  ,  up  75  cents  ,  in  New  York  Stock  Exchange  composite  trading  . 
 A  spokeswoman  said  Dow  is  comfortable  with  Wall  Street  expectations  that  full-year  earnings  will  total  about  $  14.60  a  share  ,  compared  with  last  year  's  record  net  of  $  2.4  billion  ,  or  $  12.76  a  share  .  But  that  signal  on  full-year  profit  casts  doubt  on  whether  Dow  will  improve  on  its  year-ago  fourth-quarter  net  of  $  3.44  a  share  ,  or  $  635  million  .  Dow  would  earn  $  14.85  a  share  for  the  year  if  it  equaled  that  year-ago  fourth-quarter  performance  . 
 Dow  officials  were  signaling  that  the  company  would  earn  less  than  $  15  a  share  this  year  even  before  they  announced  in  July  a  plan  to  acquire  67  %  of  Marion  Laboratories  Inc  .  That  acquisition  could  further  dilute  earnings  per  share  this  year  ,  the  company  spokeswoman  said  .  Dow  has  n't  said  exactly  what  impact  the  Marion  acquisition  will  have  on  1989  earnings  . 
 Dow  blamed  the  third-quarter  earnings  drop  on  several  factors  ,  including  softer  prices  for  polyethylene  and  other  basic  chemicals  ,  a  slower  U.S.  economy  and  a  stronger  dollar  ,  which  made  Dow  's  exports  from  the  U.S.  more  expensive  to  overseas  customers  .  Another  problem  was  a  7  %  increase  in  operating  costs  at  a  time  when  revenue  was  rising  by  only  2  %  . 
 For  the  first  nine  months  of  the  year  ,  Dow  earned  $  2.06  billion  ,  or  $  11.41  a  share  ,  up  17  %  from  $  1.76  billion  ,  or  $  9.32  a  share  ,  a  year  ago  .  Sales  for  the  latest  nine  months  rose  7.7  %  to  $  13.34  billion  from  $  12.38  billion  in  the  year-ago  period  . 
 Whether  or  not  ``  great  cases  make  bad-law  ''  --  as  Justice  Holmes  asserted  --  who  can  doubt  that  when  great  confirmation  hearings  turn  on  the  nominee  's  response  to  these  great  cases  they  make  bad  judicial  history  ? 
 Ethan  Bronner  's  ``  Battle  for  Justice  :  How  the  Bork  Nomination  Shook  America  ''  (  Norton  ,  399  pages  ,  $  22.50  )  is  a  spirited  narrative  of  the  nastiest  of  these  hearings  ,  done  with  journalistic  verve  ,  but  with  a  flawed  legal  philosophy  .  While  the  book  amply  justifies  its  subtitle  ,  the  title  itself  is  dubious  .  What  shook  America  was  not  a  battle  for  justice  but  for  naked  power  ,  in  which  an  army  of  judicial  activists  rolled  over  a  judge  they  had  demonized  . 
 In  its  basic  structure  and  style  the  book  is  novelistic  ,  with  piquant  character  portrayal  ,  hard-wire  action  and  devious  intrigue  of  the  sort  more  likely  to  be  encountered  in  a  Washington  docudrama  than  in  a  constitutional  history  . 
 Mr.  Bronner  seems  to  believe  that  the  hearings  could  have  gone  either  way  .  I  doubt  that  .  Given  Democratic  frustration  with  the  Reagan  victories  and  Court  appointments  ,  the  contingency  plans  in  place  ,  and  Mr.  Bork  's  paper  trail  of  vulnerable  writings  ,  it  was  pretty  clear  that  Judge  Bork  never  stood  much  chance  of  being  confirmed  .  As  Mr.  Bronner  himself  says  ,  the  smell  of  ``  raw  meat  ''  was  in  the  air  . 
 Perhaps  because  they  won  ,  Mr.  Bork  's  attackers  come  through  more  vividly  than  his  defenders  .  Ralph  Neas  was  the  organizing  genius  ,  whipping  a  conglomerate  of  pressure  groups  into  an  irresistible  attacking  force  .  Harvard  's  Laurence  Tribe  was  the  constitutional  heavy  ,  laying  out  legal  strategies  for  the  senators  and  witnesses  to  follow  .  But  it  was  Ted  Kennedy  who  scored  most  effectively  with  his  searing  portrayal  of  ``  Robert  Bork  's  America  ''  --  the  parade  of  imaginary  horribles  that  would  follow  logically  ,  he  claimed  ,  from  the  positions  Mr.  Bork  had  taken  over  the  space  of  two  decades  .  Sen.  Kennedy  ,  never  mind  his  dubious  credentials  for  the  moral  high  ground  ,  emoted  brilliantly  . 
 I  add  two  others  .  Republican  Sen.  Arlen  Specter  of  Pennsylvania  engaged  the  nominee  in  a  verbal  contest  aimed  at  showing  that  Mr.  Bork  was  willing  to  stretch  the  Constitution  in  one  area  (  free  speech  )  while  remaining  rigid  in  all  the  others  .  It  achieved  a  good  media  play  ,  and  enabled  Sen.  Specter  and  others  to  vote  against  Mr.  Bork  out  of  ``  conscience  .  ''  Further  ammunition  came  from  left  legal  theorist  Ronald  Dworkin  ,  who  in  the  New  York  Review  of  Books  painted  a  picture  of  a  constitutional  zombie  willfully  reading  his  personal  prejudices  into  the  Constitution  ,  particularly  in  the  area  of  ``  original  intent  .  ''  The  charge  of  being  ``  outside  the  mainstream  ''  of  legal  thought  gravely  undercut  Mr.  Bork  's  scholarly  standing  ,  leaving  him  bleeding  on  the  platform  . 
 The  nomination  still  might  have  been  salvaged  if  a  number  of  Democratic  moderates  in  the  South  and  Southwest  had  broken  party  lines  .  But  Democratic  Sen.  Bennett  Johnson  of  Louisiana  reminded  the  little  band  that  anti-Bork  blacks  and  women  could  furnish  the  margin  to  punish  them  in  their  next  Senate  elections  .  Demographics  converged  with  ``  mainstream  ''  and  demonizing  to  seal  Robert  Bork  's  fate  . 
 The  upshot  ?  Mr.  Bork  's  opponents  chose  the  battlefield  ,  held  it  and  kept  it  .  Yet  with  the  smooth  confirmation  of  Anthony  Kennedy  ,  an  ``  80  percenter  ''  only  slightly  less  supportive  of  judicial  restraint  than  Mr.  Bork  ,  the  Democrats  may  have  won  the  battle  but  lost  the  war  . 
 Another  upshot  ,  however  ,  was  the  chilling  message  the  Bork  hearings  sent  into  the  judicial  culture  from  which  the  Supreme  Court  draws  its  talent  .  The  word  went  forth  to  every  law  school  that  those  with  federal  court  ambitions  must  travel  a  safe  constitutional  journey  ,  with  no  paper  trail  and  no  bite  to  their  tongue  or  pen  . 
 Unfortunately  ,  the  author  simply  does  n't  supply  the  philosophical  frame  to  sustain  his  reportorial  talents  .  He  has  too  readily  swallowed  the  case  for  the  activist  law  school  culture  .  Probing  more  deeply  into  the  doctrine  of  ``  judicial  restraint  ,  ''  he  would  have  found  a  long  history  going  back  to  the  great  decisions  of  Justice  Holmes  .  He  would  discover  it  also  in  Alexander  Bickel  ,  a  subtle  constitutional  scholar  ,  Mr.  Bork  's  closest  friend  at  Yale  ,  whose  influence  on  the  judge  goes  well  beyond  Mr.  Bronner  's  reporting  . 
 Still  ,  the  long  view  of  Robert  Bork  as  constitutional  thinker  must  be  a  spotty  one  .  His  strength  lies  in  his  majoritarian  doctrine  ,  which  keeps  the  Court  clear  of  transient  group  pressures  and  leaves  most  decisions  in  a  democracy  to  elected  legislatures  and  executives  .  Unfortunately  ,  Mr.  Bork  failed  to  distinguish  between  such  pressures  and  the  emergence  of  great  issues  critical  to  a  society  that  must  be  settled  judicially  if  it  is  to  cohere  . 
 The  question  of  segregated  schools  ,  in  Brown  vs.  Board  of  Education  ,  was  such  an  issue  .  In  our  time  abortion  has  become  another  ,  best  left  to  a  line  of  Supreme  Court  decisions  rather  than  to  the  chaos  of  50  state  legislatures  .  A  reflective  and  growing  consensus  of  Americans  clearly  wishes  to  apply  the  right  to  privacy  in  contraceptive  matters  (  decided  in  the  Griswold  case  )  to  abortion  as  well  .  One  can  understand  Mr.  Bork  's  fear  that  the  new  right  to  privacy  will  become  intolerably  stretched  ,  though  a  Supreme  Court  composed  of  men  and  women  with  realism  ,  guts  and  a  sense  of  limits  should  be  able  to  manage  it  .  What  is  certain  is  that  if  Americans  allow  another  happening  like  the  degrading  Bork  confirmation  circus  ,  it  will  be  at  their  peril  . 
 Mr.  Lerner  is  a  writer  and  historian  living  in  New  York  . 
 Sotheby  's  Inc.  ,  the  world  's  biggest  auction  house  ,  is  taking  a  huge  Wall  Street-style  risk  on  the  outcome  of  the  sale  of  art  from  the  estate  of  John  T.  Dorrance  Jr.  ,  the  Campbell  Soup  Co.  heir  . 
 The  Financial  Services  division  has  guaranteed  the  Dorrance  family  that  it  will  receive  a  minimum  of  $  100  million  for  the  collection  ,  regardless  of  what  the  bids  for  the  art  works  total  ,  people  close  to  the  transaction  say  .  The  collection  ,  which  includes  two  early  Picassos  ,  a  van  Gogh  ,  a  Monet  ,  other  paintings  ,  furniture  and  porcelains  ,  went  on  sale  last  night  in  the  first  of  six  auctions  . 
 What  Sotheby  's  is  doing  closely  resembles  an  underwriting  by  an  investment  bank  .  A  corporation  that  wants  to  sell  stock  or  bonds  goes  to  a  Wall  Street  firm  ,  which  purchases  the  securities  outright  ,  accepting  the  financial  risk  of  finding  buyers  .  If  the  investment  bank  can  sell  the  securities  at  a  higher  price  than  it  paid  the  issuer  ,  it  makes  a  profit  . 
 At  the  initial  sale  last  night  ,  for  example  --  the  sale  featuring  the  Impressionists  masters  --  bids  totaled  $  116  million  .  That  was  slightly  above  Sotheby  's  presale  estimate  of  $  111  million  .  Normally  ,  Sotheby  's  would  have  earned  20  %  of  the  total  in  commissions  .  Instead  ,  people  familiar  with  the  transaction  said  ,  the  auction  house  opted  to  forgo  that  percentage  in  order  to  obtain  the  collection  and  in  exchange  for  taking  a  bigger  chunk  of  proceeds  exceeding  $  100  million  . 
 Art  dealers  say  that  while  auction  houses  occasionally  guarantee  the  seller  of  a  highly  desirable  work  of  art  a  minimum  price  ,  a  financial  commitment  of  this  size  is  unprecedented  . 
 Diana  D.  Brooks  ,  president  of  Sotheby  's  North  America  division  ,  vehemently  denies  it  offered  the  Dorrance  heirs  a  money-back  guarantee  ,  calling  such  reports  ``  inaccurate  .  ''  Buried  in  the  glossy  hardbound  catalog  for  the  sale  ,  however  ,  appears  the  statement  ,  ``  Sotheby  's  has  an  interest  in  the  property  in  this  catalog  .  '' 
 Explains  a  Sotheby  's  spokeswoman  ,  the  statement  ``  means  exactly  what  it  says  .  We  have  some  level  of  financial  interest  ''  in  the  collection  .  ``  We  do  n't  disclose  specifics  .  '' 
 Frank  Mirabello  ,  a  lawyer  for  the  Dorrance  estate  with  the  Philadelphia  law  firm  of  Morgan  ,  Lewis  &  Bockius  ,  declines  to  comment  on  the  financial  arrangements  . 
 Sotheby  's  made  the  $  100  million  guarantee  to  keep  the  Dorrance  collection  away  from  its  archrival  ,  auction  house  Christie  's  International  PLC  ;  Christie  's  has  handled  smaller  sales  for  the  Dorrance  family  over  the  years  . 
 When  Christie  's  officials  asked  why  the  firm  was  n't  picked  to  sell  the  Dorrance  collection  ,  representatives  of  the  Dorrance  family  ``  told  us  it  was  a  question  of  financial  considerations  ,  ''  said  Michael  Findlay  ,  Christie  's  head  of  impressionist  and  modern  paintings  . 
 Collectors  who  have  made  their  money  on  Wall  Street  have  become  an  increasingly  important  part  of  the  art  business  and  their  money  has  helped  fuel  the  art  boom  ,  but  recently  it  appears  Sotheby  's  has  been  returning  the  compliment  . 
 In  November  1987  ,  Sotheby  's  essentially  offered  a  Wall  Street-style  ``  bridge  loan  ''  of  about  $  27  million  to  Australian  businessman  Alan  Bond  to  enable  him  to  purchase  Vincent  van  Gogh  's  ``  Irises  ''  for  $  53.9  million  .  It  was  the  highest  bid  in  history  for  a  work  of  art  .  But  two  weeks  ago  ,  Sotheby  's  said  that  it  has  the  painting  under  lock  and  key  because  the  loan  had  not  been  fully  repaid  . 
 Sotheby  's  is  offering  such  deals  because  it  's  an  art  sellers  '  market  ,  at  least  where  the  best  works  are  concerned  ,  says  Ralph  Lerner  ,  an  attorney  and  author  of  the  book  ``  Art  Law  .  ''  ``  There  seems  to  be  a  lot  of  art  for  sale  ,  but  there  's  more  competition  .  The  competition  gives  the  seller  the  ability  to  cut  a  better  deal  ,  ''  he  says  . 
 The  Dorrance  family  will  still  receive  a  substantial  portion  of  the  auction  proceeds  above  $  100  million  ,  people  familiar  with  the  transaction  said  .  But  it  's  likely  that  Sotheby  's  will  take  a  higher  than  usual  commission  ,  called  an  override  ,  on  the  amount  exceeding  the  guarantee  . 
 Sotheby  's  has  been  aggressively  promoting  the  Dorrance  sale  .  At  a  news  conference  last  May  announcing  plans  for  the  auction  ,  Sotheby  's  estimated  its  value  in  excess  of  $  100  million  .  More  recently  ,  Sotheby  's  has  predicted  the  collection  will  fetch  $  140  million  .  That  's  the  highest  estimate  for  a  single  collection  in  auction  history  . 
 The  decision  to  put  the  entire  collection  on  the  block  stunned  many  ,  since  Mr.  Dorrance  had  served  as  chairman  of  the  Philadelphia  Museum  of  Art  ,  and  it  had  been  assumed  many  of  the  works  would  be  donated  to  the  institution  . 
 At  last  night  's  sale  ,  13  of  44  works  that  sold  were  purchased  by  Aska  International  Gallery  ,  the  art-acquisition  unit  of  Aichi  Financial  ,  a  Japanese  conglomerate  that  owns  7.5  %  of  Christie  's  . 
 Meanwhile  ,  Sotheby  's  guarantee  is  raising  eyebrows  in  the  art  world  .  ``  The  consumer  has  to  throw  out  the  idea  that  the  auction  house  is  a  disinterested  middleman  ,  ''  says  New  York  art  dealer  David  Tunick  .  While  he  adds  that  he  has  no  problem  with  auction  houses  who  sell  works  in  which  they  have  a  financial  interest  ,  ``  It  ought  not  to  be  hidden  in  some  small  print  .  '' 
 In  such  situations  ,  he  says  ,  the  house  ``  is  going  to  put  the  best  light  on  things  .  ''  For  example  ,  an  auction  house  's  comments  on  the  condition  of  a  work  of  art  that  is  up  for  sale  should  be  looked  at  with  ``  very  open  eyes  ,  ''  he  says  . 
 ``  There  's  more  and  more  of  this  cash-up-front  going  on  at  every  level  ,  ''  says  Bruce  Miller  ,  president  of  Art  Funding  Corp.  ,  an  art  lender  .  Dealers  and  auction  houses  ``  know  if  they  do  n't  lay  out  a  half  a  million  for  this  ,  another  one  will  ;  it  's  that  competitive  .  '' 
 In  January  ,  two  small  New  York  galleries  ,  the  Coe  Kerr  Gallery  and  Beadleston  Fine  Arts  ,  snatched  a  major  art  collection  owned  by  the  Askin  family  away  from  rival  auction-house  bidders  with  an  up-front  payment  of  about  $  25  million  . 
 A  Christie  's  spokeswoman  said  that  while  the  auction  house  sometimes  waives  its  seller  's  commission  to  attract  art  works  --  it  still  gets  a  commission  from  the  buyer  --  Christie  's  wo  n't  offer  financial  guarantees  because  ``  Christie  's  believes  its  primary  role  is  as  an  auction  house  ,  and  therefore  as  an  agent  {  for  buyer  and  seller  }  ,  not  as  a  bank  .  '' 

 Egon  Krenz  ,  the  man  tapped  yesterday  to  become  East  Germany  's  new  leader  ,  faces  the  same  task  that  has  fallen  to  neighboring  socialist  colleagues  :  reforming  a  country  in  crisis  .  But  unlike  the  other  new  leaders  in  the  East  Bloc  ,  Mr.  Krenz  will  face  an  immediate  threat  to  his  nation  's  very  existence  :  German  reunification  . 
 Mr.  Krenz  ,  age  52  ,  is  known  as  an  old-guard  ironfist  ,  one  likely  to  continue  the  method  of  running  a  country  that  the  Berlin  Wall  made  famous  .  Even  if  he  were  to  change  his  stripes  and  become  another  Milton  Friedman  ,  however  ,  he  would  still  stand  a  good  chance  of  losing  a  country  . 
 Mr.  Krenz  almost  certainly  will  be  a  younger  version  of  Erich  Honecker  ,  his  rigid  predecessor  as  dictator  .  Mr.  Krenz  has  followed  much  the  same  career  path  as  Mr.  Honecker  :  Both  spent  years  overseeing  the  Freie  Deutsche  Jugend  ,  the  youth  group  that  is  the  communist  regime  's  principal  tool  for  stamping  young  Germans  into  socialist  citizens  .  More  recently  ,  Mr.  Krenz  has  been  in  charge  of  East  German  security  ,  and  is  the  youngest  member  of  the  ruling  Politburo  . 
 Faced  with  another  Mr.  Honecker  ,  so  many  despairing  East  Germans  are  likely  to  flee  that  the  two  German  peoples  will  get  their  reunification  ,  de  facto  ,  on  West  German  ground  .  But  if  East  Germany  's  arthritic  Politburo  does  loosen  up  enough  to  permit  Mr.  Krenz  to  make  serious  efforts  at  reform  ,  he  will  face  a  challenge  just  as  fundamental  .  Abandoning  socialism  means  abandoning  the  East  German  state  's  reason  for  existence  ,  and  with  it  the  justification  for  its  watchdogs  and  its  Wall  .  In  this  scenario  it  's  hard  to  imagine  that  a  pale  imitation  of  the  Federal  Republic  could  avoid  being  pulled  into  some  kind  of  tie  --  economic  ,  federal  or  stronger  --  with  West  Germany  . 
 Mr.  Krenz  may  need  a  bit  of  time  to  consolidate  his  empire  ,  which  would  do  a  lot  to  promote  Reunification  Scenario  One  .  Cartoonists  in  West  Germany  have  already  mocked  the  exodus  by  imagining  an  advertisement  placed  by  Mr.  Honecker  :  ``  Wanted  :  one  people  .  ''  The  West  German  embassies  in  Prague  ,  Budapest  and  Warsaw  are  continuing  to  find  refugees  at  their  gates  . 
 Of  course  East  Germany  ,  true  to  its  tradition  ,  could  tighten  its  borders  yet  further  .  Two  of  the  last  gestures  of  the  Honecker  regime  were  to  close  the  border  to  Czechoslovakia  and  install  halogen  lights  in  some  spots  along  the  frontier  .  But  with  world-wide  opinion  --  even  ,  apparently  in  Moscow  --  against  East  Germany  ,  the  country  would  have  to  turn  itself  into  an  Albania  to  clamp  down  further  on  refugees  . 
 There  have  been  some  reports  that  Mr.  Krenz  is  moving  to  ``  soften  ''  his  reputation  ,  notably  rumors  that  it  was  he  who  kept  East  Germany  's  state  police  off  protesters  '  backs  at  the  country  's  dismal  40th  anniversary  celebrations  earlier  this  month  .  But  even  if  he  effects  a  Hyde-to-Jekyll  transformation  ,  he  will  face  a  serious  ideological  crisis  and  Reunification  Scenario  Two  . 
 The  problem  is  one  that  East  Germany  shares  with  other  half-states  ,  such  as  North  Korea  ,  but  one  it  must  shoulder  alone  in  the  East  Bloc  .  When  Poland  moves  to  reform  ,  it  can  at  least  lean  on  its  past  :  However  flawed  and  short-lived  Joseph  Pilsudski  's  interwar  republic  ,  it  was  a  nonsocialist  democracy  .  Czech  reformers  can  recall  the  Wilsonian  ideals  of  the  same  period  in  their  country  .  Even  the  Soviet  Union  has  Peter  the  Great  to  rediscover  ,  should  it  choose  to  .  But  East  Germany  is  merely  ``  the  land  of  truly  existing  socialism  .  ''  Beyond  that  ,  it  has  to  compete  with  West  Germany  for  a  claim  to  the  German  identity  .  Up  to  now  ,  the  main  weapon  of  the  ``  worker  and  peasant  state  ''  has  been  the  ideology  of  socialism  . 
 With  talk  today  of  a  second  economic  miracle  in  West  Germany  ,  East  Germany  no  longer  can  content  itself  with  being  the  economic  star  in  a  loser  league  .  Without  Moscow  's  military  and  party  behind  it  ,  East  Germany  runs  the  risk  of  disintegrating  .  If  it  goes  capitalist  ,  and  increases  trade  with  West  Germany  ,  it  will  convert  itself  ,  willy-nilly  ,  into  an  economic  annex  of  the  Federal  Republic  .  There  's  a  certain  cruel  logic  at  work  here  :  It  's  particularly  appropriate  --  and  tragic  --  that  the  land  that  produced  Karl  Marx  should  prove  socialism  's  failure  in  an  experiment  that  uses  its  own  people  as  controls  . 
 There  may  be  forces  that  would  delay  this  scenario  .  Ideologues  are  the  last  to  surrender  ,  and  Germans  are  an  ideological  people  .  The  protesters  who  greeted  Mikhail  Gorbachev  at  East  Berlin  's  airport  earlier  this  month  were  n't  shouting  ``  Go  U.S.A  ''  --  they  were  chanting  ``  Gorby  ,  Help  Us  .  '' 
 Ideologues  on  the  other  side  of  the  border  can  also  slow  the  process  .  Helmut  Kohl  's  governing  conservative  coalition  is  proving  admirably  true  to  the  West  German  constitution  by  making  more  than  500,000  people  of  German  descent  automatic  citizens  this  year  alone  .  But  within  the  government  and  in  the  think  tanks  outside  it  ,  many  West  Germans  maintain  that  they  do  n't  want  immediate  reunification  .  Politically  ,  this  currently  is  wisdom  --  particularly  given  a  nervous  neighboring  France  .  But  it  would  be  ironic  if  Germany  's  reunification  ,  just  like  its  division  ,  eventually  were  the  result  of  actions  in  centers  of  power  other  than  Bonn  and  Berlin  . 
 In  a  statement  that  was  as  close  as  East  Germany  gets  to  practicing  ``  glasnost  ''  ,  Otto  Reinhold  ,  an  East  German  party  theorist  ,  actually  acknowledged  the  reunification  dilemma  .  ``  The  main  problem  ,  ''  Mr.  Reinhold  said  in  an  East  German  radio  interview  monitored  by  Radio  Free  Europe  in  Munich  ,  stems  from  the  fact  that  ``  the  GDR  is  different  ''  from  other  East  European  states  .  ``  What  kind  of  right  to  exist  ,  ''  he  asked  ,  ``  would  a  capitalist  German  Democratic  Republic  have  alongside  a  capitalist  Federal  Republic  ?  ''  That  's  a  question  East  Germany  ca  n't  answer  easily  ,  no  matter  what  its  new  leader  does  .

 INSURERS  ARE  FACING  billions  of  dollars  in  damage  claims  from  the  California  quake  .  But  most  businesses  in  the  Bay  area  ,  including  Silicon  Valley  ,  were  n't  greatly  affected  .  Computer  and  software  companies  in  the  region  are  expecting  virtually  no  long-term  disruption  in  shipments  .

 Leveraged  buy-outs  may  be  curbed  by  two  rules  in  pending  congressional  legislation  .  The  provisions  ,  in  deficit-reduction  bills  recently  passed  by  the  House  and  Senate  ,  could  raise  the  price  tags  of  such  deals  by  up  to  10  %  and  cool  the  takeover  boom  .

 ``  We  're  trading  with  a  very  wary  eye  on  Wall  Street  ,  ''  said  Trevor  Woodland  ,  chief  corporate  trader  at  Harris  Trust  &  Savings  Bank  in  New  York  .  ``  No  one  is  willing  to  place  a  firm  bet  that  the  stock  market  wo  n't  take  another  tumultuous  ride  .  '' 
 News  of  the  major  earthquake  in  California  Tuesday  triggered  a  round  of  dollar  sales  in  early  Asian  trade  ,  but  most  foreign-exchange  dealers  said  they  expect  the  impact  of  the  quake  on  financial  markets  to  be  short-lived  . 
 Despite  the  dollar  's  lackluster  performance  ,  some  foreign-exchange  traders  maintain  that  the  U.S.  unit  remains  relatively  well  bid  . 
 Harris  Trust  's  Mr.  Woodland  noted  that  the  unit  continues  to  show  resilience  in  the  face  of  a  barrage  of  ``  headline  negatives  ''  in  recent  weeks  ,  including  rate  increases  in  Europe  and  Japan  ,  aggressive  central  bank  intervention  ,  a  190-point  plunge  in  New  York  stock  prices  ,  an  unexpectedly  poor  U.S.  trade  report  and  action  by  the  Federal  Reserve  to  nudge  U.S.  rates  lower  . 
 While  Mr.  Woodland  does  n't  predict  a  significant  climb  for  the  U.S.  unit  in  light  of  recent  moves  in  interest  rates  around  the  world  ,  he  noted  that  ``  its  downside  potential  is  surprisingly  and  --  for  dollar  bulls  --  ``  impressively  ''  limited  . 
 In  late  New  York  trading  yesterday  ,  the  dollar  was  quoted  at  1.8485  marks  ,  down  from  1.8667  marks  late  Tuesday  ,  and  at  141.45  yen  ,  down  from  142.75  yen  late  Tuesday  .  Sterling  was  quoted  at  $  1.5920  ,  up  from  $  1.5753  late  Tuesday  . 
 In  Tokyo  Thursday  ,  the  U.S.  currency  opened  for  trading  at  140.97  yen  ,  down  from  Wednesday  's  Tokyo  close  of  142.10  yen  . 
 Since  Friday  's  dive  in  stock  market  prices  ,  the  Fed  has  injected  reserves  into  the  banking  system  in  an  effort  to  calm  the  markets  and  avert  a  repeat  of  1987  's  stock  market  debacle  . 
 Some  analysts  note  that  after  last  week  's  stock  market  tailspin  and  Tuesday  's  California  earthquake  ,  it  's  hard  to  gauge  where  the  central  bank  wants  the  key  federal  funds  rate  . 
 They  say  that  the  earthquake  ,  by  preventing  many  banks  from  operating  at  full  capacity  ,  has  given  the  Fed  an  additional  reason  to  keep  liquidity  at  a  high  level  .  The  Fed  did  ,  in  fact  ,  execute  $  1.5  billion  of  liquidity-enhancing  customer  repurchase  agreements  ,  the  third  set  of  repurchase  orders  in  three  days  .  Analysts  said  the  additional  liquidity  should  tend  to  reduce  the  federal  funds  rate  . 
 For  now  ,  traders  say  the  foreign  exchange  market  is  scrutinizing  both  federal  funds  and  events  on  Wall  Street  .  They  note  that  the  dollar  remains  extremely  vulnerable  to  the  slightest  bad  news  from  the  stock  exchange  . 
 Indeed  ,  the  U.S.  unit  edged  lower  as  the  Dow  Jones  Industrial  Average  dropped  about  13  points  in  early  trading  .  A  slight  recovery  in  the  stock  market  gave  currency  traders  confidence  to  push  the  dollar  higher  before  the  unit  dropped  back  by  day  's  end  . 
 Some  dealers  noted  that  nervousness  over  the  recent  sharp  dive  in  stock  prices  could  intensify  following  suggestions  by  Bank  of  Japan  Governor  Satoshi  Sumita  that  appeared  to  advise  Japanese  investors  to  be  very  careful  in  investing  in  U.S.  leveraged  buy-outs  . 
 Dealers  suggest  that  the  only  positive  news  on  the  horizon  that  could  detract  attention  from  equities  transactions  is  September  's  U.S.  consumer  price  data  .  The  figures  ,  due  for  release  Friday  ,  are  expected  to  show  an  uptick  in  inflation  to  4.8  %  from  4.7  %  in  August  . 
 If  the  figures  show  a  hefty  rise  in  inflation  ,  they  could  militate  against  easing  by  the  Fed  . 
 On  the  Commodity  Exchange  in  New  York  ,  gold  for  current  delivery  rose  $  1.30  to  $  368.70  an  ounce  in  moderate  trading  .  Estimated  volume  was  three  million  ounces  . 
 In  early  trading  in  Hong  Kong  Thursday  ,  gold  was  at  $  368.15  an  ounce  . 
 Crude  prices  spurted  upward  in  brisk  trading  on  the  assumption  that  heavy  earthquake  damage  occurred  to  San  Francisco  area  refinery  complexes  ,  but  the  rise  quickly  fizzled  when  it  became  apparent  that  oil  operations  were  n't  severely  curtailed  . 
 Trading  on  little  specific  information  ,  market  players  overnight  in  Tokyo  began  bidding  up  oil  prices  .  The  rally  spread  into  European  markets  ,  where  traders  were  still  betting  that  the  earthquake  disrupted  the  San  Francisco  area  's  large  oil  refining  plants  . 
 By  yesterday  morning  ,  much  of  the  world  was  still  unable  to  reach  San  Francisco  by  telephone  .  West  Texas  Intermediate  was  bid  up  more  than  20  cents  a  barrel  in  many  overseas  markets  .  At  the  opening  of  the  New  York  Mercantile  Exchange  ,  West  Texas  Intermediate  for  November  delivery  shot  up  10  cents  a  barrel  ,  to  $  20.85  ,  still  on  the  belief  that  the  refineries  were  damaged  . 
 In  the  San  Francisco  area  ,  roughly  800,000  barrels  a  day  of  crude  ,  about  a  third  of  all  the  refining  capacity  in  California  ,  is  processed  daily  ,  according  to  industry  data  .  For  more  than  the  past  year  ,  even  the  rumor  of  a  major  West  Coast  refinery  shutdown  has  been  enough  to  spark  a  futures  rally  because  the  gasoline  market  is  so  tight  . 
 But  yesterday  ,  as  the  morning  wore  on  ,  some  major  West  Coast  refinery  operators  --  including  Chevron  Corp.  ,  Exxon  Corp.  and  the  Shell  Oil  Co.  unit  of  Royal  Dutch\  Group  --  said  their  refineries  were  n't  damaged  and  were  continuing  to  operate  normally  .  Most  said  they  shut  down  their  petroleum  pipeline  operations  as  a  precaution  but  did  n't  see  any  immediate  damage  .  Gasoline  terminals  were  also  largely  unhurt  ,  they  said  . 
 ``  It  's  hard  to  imagine  how  the  markets  were  speculating  ,  given  that  nobody  could  get  through  to  San  Francisco  ,  ''  said  one  amazed  oil  company  executive  . 
 As  the  news  spread  that  the  refineries  were  intact  ,  crude  prices  plunged  ,  ending  the  day  at  $  20.56  a  barrel  ,  down  19  cents  .  Gasoline  for  November  delivery  was  off  1.26  cents  a  gallon  to  54.58  cents  .  Heating  oil  finished  at  60.6  cents  ,  down  0.45  cent  . 
 ``  The  market  was  basically  acting  on  two  contradictory  forces  ,  ''  said  Nauman  Barakat  of  Shearson  Lehman  Hutton  Inc  .  ``  One  is  the  panic  ,  the  earthquake  in  San  Francisco  ,  which  is  positive  .  '' 
 But  once  that  factor  was  eliminated  ,  traders  took  profits  and  focused  on  crude  oil  inventories  ,  Mr.  Barakat  said  .  After  the  market  closed  Tuesday  ,  the  American  Petroleum  Institute  had  reported  that  crude  stocks  increased  by  5.7  million  barrels  in  the  week  ended  Friday  ,  which  traders  viewed  as  bearish  . 
 But  some  market  players  still  think  earthquake  speculation  could  have  more  impact  on  the  oil  markets  .  ``  The  problem  is  that  while  on  the  surface  everything  is  all  right  ,  the  question  is  ,  ''  said  Mr.  Barakat  ,  ``  was  there  any  structural  damage  to  the  pipelines  or  anything  else  .  '' 
 In  other  commodity  markets  yesterday  : 
 COPPER  :  Futures  prices  eased  on  indications  of  improvement  in  the  industry  's  labor  situation  .  The  December  contract  declined  1.85  cents  a  pound  to  $  1.2645  .  According  to  one  analyst  ,  workers  at  the  Cananea  copper  mine  in  Mexico  ,  which  has  n't  been  operating  since  it  was  declared  bankrupt  by  the  Mexican  government  in  late  August  ,  are  set  to  return  to  work  .  The  analyst  said  it  will  take  about  two  to  three  months  before  the  mine  begins  to  produce  copper  in  significant  quantities  .  He  added  that  ,  while  there  has  n't  been  any  official  announcement  as  yet  ,  the  Highland  Valley  mine  strike  in  British  Columbia  ,  which  has  lasted  more  than  three  months  ,  is  regarded  as  settled  .  Another  analyst  said  the  Cananea  return  to  operation  may  not  be  as  near  as  some  expect  .  ``  There  are  still  negotiations  taking  place  on  whether  there  will  be  a  loss  of  jobs  ,  which  has  been  a  critical  issue  all  along  ,  ''  he  said  .  Nevertheless  ,  the  increasing  likelihood  that  these  two  major  supply  disruptions  will  be  resolved  weighed  on  the  market  ,  the  analysts  agreed  .  Both  of  these  mines  are  normally  major  suppliers  of  copper  to  Japan  ,  which  has  been  buying  copper  on  the  world  market  .  The  first  analyst  said  that  the  Japanese  ,  as  well  as  the  Chinese  ,  bought  copper  earlier  in  the  week  in  London  ,  but  that  this  purchasing  has  since  slackened  as  the  supply  situation  ,  at  least  over  the  long  term  ,  appears  to  have  improved  .  ``  The  focus  for  some  time  has  been  on  the  copper  supply  ,  and  good  demand  has  been  taken  for  granted  ,  ''  he  said  .  ``  Now  that  the  supply  situation  seems  to  be  improving  ,  it  would  be  best  for  traders  to  switch  their  concentration  to  the  demand  side  .  ''  He  noted  the  Commerce  Department  report  yesterday  that  housing  starts  in  September  dropped  5.2  %  from  August  to  1.26  million  units  on  an  annualized  basis  ,  the  lowest  level  in  seven  years  .  ``  Along  with  these  factors  ,  other  economic  reports  suggest  a  slowing  of  the  economy  ,  which  could  mean  reduced  copper  usage  ,  ''  he  said  . 
 SUGAR  :  Futures  prices  extended  Tuesday  's  gains  .  The  March  delivery  ended  with  an  advance  of  0.16  cent  a  pound  to  14.27  cents  ,  for  a  two-day  gain  of  0.3  cent  .  According  to  one  dealer  ,  Japan  said  it  has  only  40,000  tons  of  sugar  remaining  to  be  shipped  to  it  this  year  by  Cuba  under  current  commitments  .  The  announcement  was  made  because  of  reports  Tuesday  that  Cuba  would  delay  shipments  to  Japan  scheduled  for  later  this  year  ,  into  early  next  year  .  The  dealer  said  the  quantity  mentioned  in  the  Japanese  announcement  is  so  small  that  it  's  meaningless  .  One  analyst  said  he  thought  the  market  continued  to  be  supported  to  some  degree  by  a  delay  in  the  Cuban  sugar  harvest  caused  by  adverse  weather  .  The  dealer  said  India  might  be  the  real  factor  that  is  keeping  futures  prices  firm  .  That  country  recently  bought  200,000  tons  of  sugar  and  had  been  expected  to  seek  a  like  quantity  last  week  but  did  n't  .  ``  It  's  known  they  need  the  sugar  ,  and  the  expectation  that  they  will  come  in  is  apparently  giving  the  market  its  principal  support  ,  ''  the  dealer  said  . 
 LIVESTOCK  AND  MEATS  :  The  Agriculture  Department  is  expected  to  announce  tomorrow  that  the  number  of  cattle  in  the  13  major  ranch  states  slipped  4  %  to  8.21  million  on  Oct.  1  compared  with  the  level  a  year  earlier  ,  said  Tom  Morgan  ,  president  of  Sterling  Research  Corp.  ,  Arlington  Heights  ,  Ill  .  Cattle  prices  have  risen  in  recent  weeks  on  speculation  that  the  government  's  quarterly  report  will  signal  tighter  supplies  of  beef  .  Among  other  things  ,  the  government  is  expected  to  report  that  the  number  of  young  cattle  placed  on  feedlots  during  the  quarter  slipped  3  %  .  Feedlots  fatten  cattle  for  slaughter  ,  so  a  drop  indicates  that  the  production  of  beef  will  dip  this  winter  .  Indeed  ,  some  analysts  expect  the  government  to  report  that  the  movement  of  young  cattle  onto  feedlots  in  the  month  of  September  in  seven  big  ranch  states  dropped  8  %  compared  with  the  level  for  September  1988  .

 A  new  drug  to  prevent  the  rejection  of  transplanted  organs  has  been  successfully  used  on  more  than  100  patients  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  ,  according  to  researchers  . 
 The  drug  ,  which  is  still  in  the  experimental  phase  ,  has  n't  been  approved  yet  by  the  Food  and  Drug  Admistration  ,  and  its  long-term  effects  are  unknown  .  But  researchers  say  the  drug  ,  called  FK-506  ,  could  revolutionize  the  transplantation  field  by  reducing  harmful  side  effects  and  by  lowering  rejection  rates  .  Rejection  has  been  the  major  obstacle  in  the  approximately  30,000  organ  transplants  performed  world-wide  each  year  . 
 Researchers  began  using  the  drug  in  February  on  patients  who  had  received  kidney  ,  liver  ,  heart  and  pancreas  transplants  .  Only  two  of  111  transplants  have  been  rejected  . 
 The  drug  ,  discovered  in  1984  ,  is  metabolized  from  soil  fungus  found  in  Japan  .  The  Pittsburgh  patients  are  the  first  humans  to  be  given  the  drug  ,  which  is  made  by  Fujisawa  Pharmaceutical  Co  . 
 ``  We  're  shocked  by  it  ,  because  it  's  worked  so  fast  ,  ''  said  Dr.  Thomas  E.  Starzl  ,  director  of  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  Transplantation  Program  ,  at  a  news  conference  here  yesterday  .  ``  We  consider  it  a  life-saving  drug  ,  like  one  for  AIDS  ,  ''  said  Dr.  John  Fung  ,  an  immunologist  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  . 
 Researchers  say  they  believe  FK-506  is  100  times  more  effective  than  the  traditional  anti-rejection  drug  ,  cyclosporine  ,  made  by  Swiss  pharmaceutical  giant  Sandoz  Ltd  .  They  are  also  encouraged  by  the  relatively  mild  side  effects  of  FK-506  ,  compared  with  cyclosporine  ,  which  can  cause  renal  failure  ,  morbidity  ,  nausea  and  other  problems  .  ``  The  side  effects  {  of  cyclosporine  }  have  made  the  penalty  for  its  success  rather  high  ,  ''  Dr.  Starzl  said  . 
 Dr.  Fung  said  that  FK-506  would  not  be  available  in  the  market  for  at  least  a  year  ,  and  that  the  FDA  approval  process  usually  takes  three  years  to  five  years  .  There  are  no  firm  plans  to  expand  the  experimental  program  beyond  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  ,  whose  hospital  performs  the  most  transplants  in  the  world  . 
 Researchers  could  n't  estimate  the  cost  of  the  drug  when  it  reaches  the  market  ,  but  they  said  FK-506  will  enable  patients  to  cut  hospital  stays  by  50  %  and  reduce  the  number  of  blood  tests  used  to  monitor  the  dosage  of  cyclosporine  and  other  drugs  among  transplant  recipients  . 
 Dr.  Starzl  said  the  research  has  been  largely  financed  by  the  National  Institute  of  Health  and  by  university  funds  ,  and  that  Fujisawa  did  n't  give  the  hospital  any  grants  .  He  said  that  the  research  team  had  no  financial  stake  in  the  drug  . 
 ``  We  've  known  for  six  months  the  effect  of  this  drug  ,  and  our  advice  to  our  people  has  been  not  to  buy  the  company  's  stock  ,  ''  Dr.  Starzl  said  ,  adding  that  profiting  from  FK-506  would  n't  be  ethical  . 
 Economist  David  N.  Laband  's  Sept.  27  editorial-page  article  ,  ``  In  Hugo  's  Path  ,  a  Man-Made  Disaster  ,  ''  decries  the  control  of  price  gouging  ,  swiftly  ordered  by  South  Carolina  's  governor  after  Hurricane  Hugo  .  According  to  Mr.  Laband  ,  ``  screaming  ''  for  price  controls  occurs  when  income  redistribution  ``  threatens  to  hit  home  .  ''  To  be  sure  ,  the  threat  has  hit  home  down  here  . 
 Yet  in  Mr.  Laband  's  rehash  of  free-market  logic  ,  human  greed  and  self-interest  are  the  only  permissible  psychological  reactions  .  Allowing  uncontrolled  prices  for  necessities  would  indeed  shorten  the  lines  at  stores  ,  as  he  contends  .  But  not  because  resources  are  going  to  their  most  efficient  use  ,  leaving  scarce  goods  ``  allocated  to  those  buyers  who  place  the  highest  value  on  them  .  ''  Rather  ,  lines  would  diminish  because  at  higher  prices  many  victims  could  not  afford  necessities  such  as  food  and  medical  supplies  . 
 It  is  inhumane  to  imply  that  a  poor  ,  unemployed  woman  can  not  receive  immediate  relief  for  her  family  at  fair  prices  because  she  does  not  have  as  much  to  protect  as  a  rich  family  .  Moreover  ,  essential  relief  supplies  such  as  ice  must  be  distributed  throughout  the  population  because  of  potential  health  problems  from  spoiled  food  and  possible  outbreak  of  disease  .  Such  spillover  effects  give  the  state  a  right  to  intervene  in  the  marketplace  and  temporarily  coordinate  allocation  of  resources  . 
 Fortunately  ,  volunteers  and  charities  are  not  motivated  by  self-interest  ,  but  by  altruism  .  Why  should  they  have  to  co-exist  with  opportunists  rushing  in  to  turn  a  quick  profit  ?  These  latter-day  scalawags  would  be  ill-advised  to  take  advantage  of  the  situation  ,  if  they  ever  expect  to  face  the  people  of  South  Carolina  again  .  The  government  is  actually  protecting  avaricious  ice-baggers  and  other  profiteers  who  can  not  see  beyond  their  own  short-term  gain  . 
 South  Carolina  deserves  an  A  for  its  quick  and  timely  relief  efforts  .  Mr.  Laband  ,  meanwhile  ,  gets  an  A  for  his  rote  recital  of  economic-efficiency  arguments  .  Give  him  an  F  for  his  failure  to  understand  the  ethics  of  economic  equity  .

 Mr.  Laband  gives  us  an  idea  why  economists  '  predictions  are  usually  wrong  .  They  set  up  absurd  situations  ,  detached  from  reality  ,  and  then  try  to  reason  from  them  .  I  'm  surprised  he  did  n't  advocate  letting  people  loot  ,  since  that  behavior  can  also  be  foreseen  in  a  disaster  and  ``  every  individual  has  an  incentive  to  alter  the  distribution  of  income  in  his  favor  .  ''  Price  controls  were  ``  so  fervently  embraced  by  Charleston  ''  because  price  gouging  in  this  situation  is  equivalent  to  looting  .

 Mr.  Laband  described  one  of  the  more  insidious  threats  we  face  when  dealing  with  disasters  such  as  Hugo  --  anti-profiteering  ordinances  such  as  that  by  the  Charleston  City  Council  as  it  thrashed  about  trying  to  Do  Something  . 
 Since  he  concentrated  on  the  economic  folly  of  such  ordinances  ,  he  did  n't  mention  certain  other  of  their  effects  .  They  divert  law-enforcement  resources  at  a  time  they  are  most  needed  for  protecting  lives  and  property  .  Also  ,  rather  than  increase  supplies  ,  they  reduce  them  and  encourage  hoarding  .  And  they  ,  or  even  the  prospect  of  them  ,  discourage  disaster  preparedness  in  the  form  of  speculative  advance  stocking  of  supplies  by  merchants  .

 Would  Mr.  Laband  also  suggest  that  the  Red  Cross  ,  Salvation  Army  ,  military  units  ,  police  ,  fire  departments  ,  rescue  units  and  individual  citizens  cease  their  efforts  to  assist  Hugo  's  victims  because  they  interfere  with  his  concept  of  the  ``  free  market  ''  ? 
 What  about  those  caring  people  all  over  the  country  who  are  donating  food  ,  water  and  other  necessities  of  life  to  these  people  who  could  be  any  of  us  ?  Should  they  ,  too  ,  stop  ``  messing  with  ''  his  free  market  ?  Maybe  he  thinks  they  should  also  sell  to  the  highest  bidder  . 
 And  what  about  insurance  firms  ?  Should  they  be  required  to  pay  claims  based  on  exorbitant  costs  for  labor  and  materials  ?  Mr.  Laband  should  beware  ,  since  he  lives  in  South  Carolina  .  In  a  free  market  ,  his  insurance  rates  can  be  raised  to  recover  insurance-company  losses  .

 Having  been  through  several  tornadoes  and  hurricanes  ,  I  have  a  different  perspective  .  Mine  comes  from  seeing  thriving  communities  devastated  --  but  only  temporarily  .  Their  recovery  came  surprisingly  fast  ,  and  always  with  the  help  of  neighbors  .  The  shock  of  seeing  homes  destroyed  and  city  services  disrupted  may  cause  some  to  confuse  priorities  such  as  the  true  economic  value  of  a  freezer  full  of  meat  . 
 In  Texas  after  Hurricane  Alicia  ,  major  grocery  chains  used  their  truck  fleets  to  ship  essential  goods  to  Houston  ,  no  gouging  ,  just  good  will  .

 We  here  in  the  affected  areas  were  dazzled  by  Mr.  Laband  's  analysis  of  time  values  and  his  comparisons  of  effectiveness  concerning  research  and  development  .  His  theoretical  approach  and  its  publication  in  this  venerable  paper  are  no  doubt  a  noteworthy  accomplishment  for  him  .  Too  bad  theory  fails  in  practice  . 
 We  consumers  tend  to  have  long  memories  .  The  businesses  subscribing  to  Mr.  Laband  's  effective  price  system  will  be  remembered  when  normalcy  returns  .  Perhaps  ,  considering  the  value  of  our  time  ,  we  will  be  unable  to  patronize  their  establishments  in  the  post-Hugo  era  . 
 I  have  a  question  for  Mr.  Laband  :  How  do  I  explain  to  the  single  mother  of  three  standing  in  line  next  to  me  for  the  past  three  hours  that  the  two  bags  of  ice  she  needs  to  keep  her  children  's  food  edible  will  take  her  last  $  20  ?  I  'm  sure  she  'll  appreciate  what  an  efficient  reaction  to  her  problems  the  price  system  has  created  .

 This  seems  to  be  the  season  for  revivals  in  Chicago  .  Though  the  Cubs  '  championship  season  ended  with  the  National  League  playoffs  ,  a  revival  of  the  Organic  Theater  's  production  of  ``  Bleacher  Bums  ,  ''  a  play  in  nine  innings  set  in  the  Wrigley  Field  bleachers  ,  continues  within  spitting  distance  of  the  ballpark  . 
 Revivals  of  a  different  sort  also  are  being  offered  by  our  two  major  theater  troupes  ,  the  Goodman  and  Steppenwolf  .  Each  is  more  problematic  than  an  unexpected  divisional  baseball  championship  ,  but  both  help  explain  why  Chicago  remains  a  vital  center  of  this  country  's  regional  theater  movement  . 
 The  Goodman  is  offering  a  modernized  version  of  Moliere  's  ``  The  Misanthrope  ''  through  Nov.  4  .  The  original  is  a  comedy  about  Alceste  ,  a  man  who  sees  falseness  and  vanity  in  everyone  except  himself  .  He  is  the  jealous  friend  of  Philinte  ,  and  the  jealous  lover  of  Celimene  .  The  play  is  filled  with  intrigue  ,  dishonesty  and  injustice  . 
 Twenty-five  years  ago  the  poet  Richard  Wilbur  modernized  this  17th-century  comedy  merely  by  avoiding  ``  the  zounds  sort  of  thing  ,  ''  as  he  wrote  in  his  introduction  .  Otherwise  ,  the  scene  remained  Celimene  's  house  in  1666  .  Assuming  modern  audiences  readily  understand  that  Moliere  's  social  indictment  covers  their  world  as  well  as  17th-century  Paris  ,  Mr.  Wilbur  concentrated  his  formidable  artistry  on  rendering  the  Alexandrine  French  verse  into  sprightly  and  theatrical  English  iambic  pentameter  .  The  Wilbur  translation  is  remarkable  --  well  worth  a  read  and  even  better  seen  in  the  theater  if  you  ever  have  the  opportunity  . 
 But  if  you  happen  to  be  coming  to  Chicago  in  the  next  few  weeks  ,  do  n't  fail  to  have  a  look  at  Robert  Falls  's  ``  The  Misanthrope  ''  at  the  Goodman  .  If  Mr.  Wilbur  's  translation  is  a  finely  ground  lens  through  which  we  see  the  pettiness  and  corruption  of  17th-century  Paris  ,  Mr.  Falls  's  production  is  a  mirror  in  which  we  see  ourselves  . 
 Mr.  Falls  ,  the  Goodman  's  artistic  director  ,  took  a  recent  adaptation  by  Neil  Bartlett  and  significantly  adapted  it  .  Mr.  Bartlett  had  slimmed  Moliere  's  cast  of  characters  to  six  and  set  them  in  the  London  media  world  of  Thatcherite  Britain  .  Mr.  Falls  transfers  the  setting  to  Hollywood  ,  and  transforms  the  characters  into  what  passes  for  aristocracy  there  --  agents  ,  producers  ,  actors  ,  writers  and  sycophants  . 
 It  works  .  Mr.  Bartlett  managed  to  more  or  less  maintain  Moliere  's  Alexandrine  verse  form  ,  12  syllable  lines  in  rhyming  couplets  .  Mr.  Falls  kept  the  form  ,  but  Americanized  it  with  Mr.  Bartlett  's  further  help  .  With  a  splendid  cast  led  by  David  Darlow  as  Alceste  ,  Christina  Haag  as  Celimene  and  ,  especially  ,  William  Brown  as  a  Philinte  who  plays  the  Hollywood  game  but  harbors  authentic  values  and  feelings  ,  the  Goodman  production  barrels  through  an  all-night  Hollywood  party  with  exuberance  and  wit  .  If  this  version  ,  with  its  references  to  Steven  Spielberg  ,  Spago  and  ``  thirtysomething  ''  attracts  younger  audiences  who  might  stay  away  from  the  classical  version  ,  then  Messrs.  Bartlett  and  Falls  are  justified  in  abandoning  Mr.  Wilbur  . 
 A  300-year-old  play  may  be  easier  to  revive  than  one  merely  25  .  The  Steppenwolf  Theatre  Company  ,  back  from  a  critical  and  box  office  success  in  London  with  its  adaptation  of  Steinbeck  's  ``  The  Grapes  of  Wrath  ,  ''  opened  the  new  season  with  Harold  Pinter  's  ``  The  Homecoming  ,  ''  first  produced  by  the  Royal  Shakespeare  Company  in  1965  . 
 Back  then  ,  Mr.  Pinter  was  not  only  the  angry  young  British  playwright  ,  but  also  the  first  to  use  silences  and  sentence  fragments  and  menacing  stares  ,  almost  to  the  exclusion  of  what  we  previously  understood  to  be  theatrical  dialogue  .  When  ``  The  Homecoming  ''  was  first  produced  on  this  side  of  the  Atlantic  ,  actors  and  directors  were  reverential  .  Silences  were  lengthy  --  nobody  moved  or  gestured  .  Nobody  smiled  onstage  ,  and  nobody  in  the  audience  was  encouraged  to  laugh  .  This  kind  of  theater  was  new  to  us  .  Also  ,  it  was  not  a  funny  time  over  here  ,  what  with  the  Vietnam  War  ,  the  '68  Democratic  convention  ,  assassinations  and  riots  . 
 But  under  Jerry  Perry  's  direction  the  current  Steppenwolf  production  ,  scheduled  to  play  through  Nov.  19  ,  breaks  through  the  flat  and  boring  ritual  that  ``  The  Homecoming  ''  had  become  .  Led  by  a  near-perfect  performance  by  Alan  Wilder  as  Max  ,  the  father  ,  the  play  is  at  once  an  appalling  and  hilarious  dissection  of  a  family  's  rage  ,  bitterness  ,  fear  and  isolation  .  Encouraged  by  Mr.  Wilder  's  sly  grins  ,  embarrassed  grimaces  and  sputtering  rages  ,  the  audience  gets  the  joke  and  begins  to  laugh  before  the  end  of  the  first  act  . 
 Three  of  the  family  members  ,  Max  and  his  two  sons  ,  Lenny  and  Joey  ,  live  off  the  flesh  :  Max  is  a  retired  butcher  ,  Lenny  a  pimp  and  Joey  an  aspiring  boxer  .  Sam  ,  Max  's  brother  ,  has  escaped  the  flesh  by  working  as  a  liveried  chauffeur  and  never  seeking  a  wife  .  Teddy  ,  the  eldest  of  Max  's  sons  ,  has  made  the  most  dramatic  escape  by  becoming  a  professor  of  philosophy  at  an  American  university  . 
 Though  it  's  clearly  Max  's  wife  who  held  sway  here  until  her  death  ,  now  none  of  the  other  male  residents  of  this  misbegotten  household  can  challenge  Max  .  The  play  concerns  Teddy  's  homecoming  with  his  wife  of  six  years  ,  Ruth  .  Curiously  ,  Randall  Arney  as  Teddy  seems  the  only  cast  member  unable  to  get  beyond  the  zombie  approach  to  a  Pinter  character  .  As  Ruth  ,  Moira  Harris  ,  a  large  and  beautiful  woman  who  may  be  our  next  Colleen  Dewhurst  ,  begins  almost  immediately  to  overpower  each  of  the  men  .  In  the  end  ,  Teddy  returns  alone  to  America  ,  leaving  Ruth  in  Max  's  chair  .  We  have  seen  her  develop  within  a  few  hours  from  a  shy  and  unknown  in-law  to  a  goddess  of  the  flesh  who  will  replace  the  dead  mother  ,  and  then  some  . 
 While  Steppenwolf  was  in  London  with  ``  The  Grapes  of  Wrath  ,  ''  Bruce  Sagan  ,  the  president  of  its  board  of  directors  ,  quietly  returned  to  Chicago  to  buy  a  piece  of  real  estate  in  the  city  's  rapidly  reviving  North  Halsted  Street  restaurant  and  theater  district  .  Within  a  year  he  hopes  Steppenwolf  will  move  into  a  new  500-seat  theater  on  that  site  .  The  troupe  currently  performs  in  a  converted  dairy  that  seats  211  and  provides  little  capacity  for  staging  anything  beyond  a  simple  one-set  production  .  ``  If  we  wanted  to  stage  `  Death  of  a  Salesman  ,  '  ``  Mr.  Sagan  says  ,  ``  Willie  Loman  would  have  to  live  in  a  ranch  house  because  of  the  low  ceiling  .  '' 
 Steppenwolf  needs  the  extra  seats  even  more  than  the  fly  space  .  It  's  currently  forced  to  turn  away  many  potential  subscribers  beyond  the  13,000  who  can  be  accommodated  in  its  present  digs  .  For  all  the  attention  that  Chicago  theater  has  received  during  the  past  decade  ,  not  one  new  building  has  been  devoted  to  it  .  Mr.  Sagan  ,  a  former  publisher  and  real  estate  developer  ,  has  put  together  an  $  8  million  financial  package  that  includes  approximately  $  4  million  of  tax  exempt  bonds  issued  by  the  State  of  Illinois  (  the  first  time  that  a  state  has  used  its  educational  facilities  authority  to  support  construction  of  a  theater  )  ,  and  approximately  $  1  million  in  grants  from  the  National  Endowment  for  the  Arts  ,  the  MacArthur  Foundation  ,  and  a  few  other  deep  pockets  .  The  rest  ,  he  is  confident  ,  can  be  raised  .  His  board  members  alone  have  pledged  $  800,000  and  he  is  just  beginning  to  massage  local  foundations  and  corporations  . 
 Mr.  Sagan  compares  the  importance  of  Steppenwolf  with  Orson  Welles  's  Mercury  Theater  in  the  '30s  .  But  Welles  's  theater  company  turned  out  to  have  a  brief  --  one  might  say  a  mercurial  --  existence  .  What  will  Mr.  Sagan  do  with  his  new  theater  building  if  the  allure  of  Hollywood  and  Broadway  proves  too  much  for  such  Steppenwolf  stalwarts  as  John  Malkovich  (  ``  Dangerous  Liaisons  ''  )  ,  Joan  Allen  (  ``  The  Heidi  Chronicles  ''  )  ,  and  Glenne  Headly  (  ``  Lonesome  Dove  ''  )  ,  and  the  company  crumbles  ?  ``  That  's  OK  ,  ''  Mr.  Sagan  replies  .  ``  Let  this  building  be  Steppenwolf  's  legacy  to  Chicago  theater  .  ''

 After  enduring  three  days  of  heavy  selling  ,  the  beleaguered  Nasdaq  over-the-counter  market  finally  rebounded  ,  rising  sharply  in  hearty  trading  . 
 The  Nasdaq  Composite  Index  jumped  0.7  %  ,  or  3.35  ,  to  463.28  .  It  rose  more  than  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  Composite  ,  which  improved  0.2  %  .  Among  bigger  stocks  ,  the  Nasdaq  100  Index  rose  1  %  ,  or  4.56  ,  to  453.05  ,  while  the  Dow  Jones  Industrial  Average  was  up  0.2  %  . 
 Richard  Bruno  ,  head  of  OTC  trading  at  PaineWebber  ,  said  the  OTC  market  has  a  habit  of  lagging  big  moves  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  .  While  the  industrial  average  rallied  on  Monday  following  last  Friday  's  collapse  ,  the  OTC  market  ,  which  did  n't  suffer  too  badly  during  the  correction  ,  tumbled  . 
 ``  Our  market  got  hit  a  lot  harder  on  Monday  than  the  listed  market  ,  ''  Mr.  Bruno  said  .  ``  We  're  just  recovering  and  getting  back  to  business  as  usual  .  I  'm  encouraged  by  the  action  .  '' 
 The  trading  pace  was  busy  ,  with  4,343  issues  and  147.6  million  shares  changing  hands  .  Advancing  issues  beat  declining  ones  ,  1,271  to  811  . 
 Much  of  the  jockeying  by  OTC  traders  and  investors  centered  on  shares  of  companies  that  might  be  financially  affected  by  damage  from  the  devastating  earthquake  in  northern  California  .  As  investors  speculated  about  the  long  -  and  short-term  implications  ,  shares  of  a  number  of  companies  that  might  either  profit  or  face  problems  because  of  the  disaster  were  actively  traded  .  Heading  the  list  :  insurance  ,  construction  and  technology  companies  located  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area  . 
 Insurance-related  stocks  were  mixed  as  investors  tried  to  figure  out  how  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  property  damage  and  deaths  on  those  concerns  .  Traders  said  property-casualty  companies  with  the  heaviest  exposure  in  the  San  Francisco  area  include  the  OTC  's  Safeco  and  Ohio  Casualty  . 
 Frank  Gilmartin  ,  a  trader  who  follows  insurance  stocks  for  Fox-Pitt  Kelton  ,  said  his  strategy  was  to  sell  early  . 
 Then  ,  if  the  stocks  fell  sharply  ,  he  planned  to  begin  buying  them  aggressively  ,  on  the  theory  that  the  companies  that  insure  against  property  damage  and  accidents  will  have  to  raise  rates  eventually  to  compensate  for  the  claims  they  will  pay  to  earthquake  victims  and  victims  of  last  month  's  Hurricane  Hugo  .  As  well  ,  reinsurers  and  insurance  brokerage  companies  will  have  improved  profits  . 
 Many  investors  expected  damage  from  the  hurricane  to  be  the  catalyst  for  higher  rates  in  the  industry  ,  which  has  been  depressed  because  of  low  rates  arising  from  intense  competition  .  But  Mr.  Gilmartin  said  the  hurricane  damage  was  n't  extensive  enough  to  prompt  premium  boosts  .  ``  The  companies  just  gave  back  what  they  had  reserved  for  ,  ''  he  said  .  ``  Now  ,  they  'll  have  to  increase  their  coffers  to  protect  for  the  future  and  that  means  rate  increases  .  '' 
 Overall  OTC  insurance  issues  were  mixed  .  Safeco  fell  1\  to  32  5\  on  462,900  shares  .  Ohio  Casualty  rose  1\  to  51  3\  on  137,200  shares  .  St.  Paul  Cos.  jumped  2  to  59  3\  on  517,500  shares  .  Academy  Insurance  fell  1\  to  1  3\  ;  but  volume  totaled  1.2  million  shares  .  The  Nasdaq  Insurance  Index  jumped  4.15  to  529.32  on  the  day  ,  while  the  barometer  of  big  insurance  and  banking  issues  climbed  1.72  to  455.29  . 
 Investors  expect  SunGard  Data  Systems  ,  a  company  that  provides  disaster  recovery  services  for  computer-dependent  businesses  ,  to  profit  from  the  earthquake  .  SunGard  's  stock  rose  1  3\  to  21  1\  on  194,000  shares  . 
 Shares  of  Kasler  ,  a  California  road  and  bridge  builder  ,  were  heavily  traded  ,  jumping  2  1\  to  9  7\  on  1.3  million  shares  . 
 Guy  F.  Atkinson  added  7\  to  16  7\  ,  on  335,700  shares  .  The  company  ,  based  in  San  Francisco  ,  provides  industrial  infrastructure  engineering  and  construction  services  . 
 Traders  were  initially  nervous  about  shares  of  companies  ,  including  many  leading  OTC  computer  companies  ,  such  as  Apple  Computer  with  offices  in  the  vicinity  of  the  area  damaged  by  the  quake  .  But  most  of  those  stocks  fared  well  .  Apple  Computer  gained  1  to  48  1\  ;  Ashton-Tate  rose  3\  to  10  3\  .  Intel  also  added  3\  to  33  7\  .  But  Sun  Microsystems  slipped  1\  to  17  1\  .  Shares  of  biotechnology  companies  in  the  area  were  also  higher  .  Chiron  was  up  1\  to  27  and  Cetus  gained  1\  to  16  3\  . 
 The  stocks  of  computer-related  companies  located  outside  California  improved  ,  too  .  Microsoft  advanced  1  7\  to  80  1\  and  Lotus  Development  added  1  1\  to  32  1\  . 
 In  other  earthquake-related  news  ,  Hambrecht  &  Quist  's  OTC  market  makers  were  excused  from  trading  yesterday  and  its  positions  were  frozen  for  the  day  by  the  National  Association  of  Securities  Dealers  .  Power  could  n't  be  restored  at  the  company  's  San  Francisco  headquarters  to  allow  trading  yesterday  morning  .  In  New  York  ,  Roger  Killion  ,  a  Hambrecht  executive  vice  president  ,  said  he  expects  OTC  trading  at  the  company  to  resume  this  morning  ,  either  in  New  York  or  in  San  Francisco  . 
 In  other  trading  ,  Medco  Containment  Services  gained  7\  to  15  on  1.9  million  shares  after  reporting  a  loss  for  the  first  quarter  ,  which  ended  Sept.  30  .  The  company  earned  $  6.6  million  in  the  year-earlier  quarter  . 
 Jaguar  's  American  depositary  receipts  added  3\  to  10  3\  on  volume  of  1.1  million  .  Analysts  in  London  believe  investors  ,  despite  their  stampede  to  dump  takeover  stocks  ,  should  hold  on  tight  to  their  Jaguar  shares  ,  this  newspaper  's  Heard  on  the  Street  column  said  yesterday  . 
 Amgen  rose  1  1\  to  50  3\  in  heavy  trading  .  Analysts  figure  Amgen  could  benefit  as  a  result  of  troubles  facing  its  competitor  ,  Genetics  Institute  ,  over  the  anti-anemia  drug  EPO  .  Genetics  Institute  disclosed  recently  that  it  is  embroiled  in  a  dispute  with  Boehringer  Mannheim  ,  which  distributes  the  drug  ,  regarding  the  usability  of  some  batches  . 
 Ciba-Geigy  Ltd.  and  Chiron  Corp.  said  they  extended  their  offer  for  Connaught  BioSciences  Inc.  ,  valued  at  866  million  Canadian  dollars  (  US$  736  million  )  to  Oct.  27  . 
 The  companies  earlier  said  they  did  n't  want  to  raise  their  offer  to  match  a  rival  bid  by  Institut  Merieux  S.A.  of  C$  37  a  share  ,  or  C$  942  million  .  But  they  said  the  C$  30-a-share  bid  ,  which  was  due  to  expire  Monday  ,  may  still  be  extended  or  varied  . 
 Merieux  ,  a  vaccine  manufacturer  based  in  Lyon  ,  France  ,  is  51%-held  by  French  state-owned  Rhone-Poulenc  S.A  .  Ciba-Geigy  is  a  major  pharmaceutical  concern  based  in  Basel  ,  Switzerland  .  Chiron  ,  another  pharmaceutical  concern  ,  is  based  in  Emeryville  ,  Calif  .  Connaught  is  a  biotechnology  research  and  vaccine  manufacturing  concern  . 
 Institut  Merieux  's  bid  for  Toronto-based  Connaught  has  run  into  problems  with  the  Canadian  government  ,  which  told  Merieux  last  week  that  it  was  n't  convinced  that  the  proposed  acquisition  would  be  of  ``  net  benefit  ''  to  Canada  .  Merieux  officials  are  expected  to  meet  with  federal  officials  in  Ottawa  today  to  discuss  the  decision  . 
 Within  minutes  after  the  stock  market  closed  Friday  ,  I  called  Sen.  Bill  Bradley  of  New  Jersey  ,  advised  him  that  the  Dow  Jones  Industrial  Average  had  declined  by  190  points  late  that  afternoon  ,  and  cheerfully  informed  him  that  he  and  his  fellow  Democrats  were  to  blame  . 
 They  had  dealt  a  major  setback  that  afternoon  to  President  Bush  's  capital-gains  tax  cut  proposal  ,  which  had  seemed  in  the  bag  after  it  passed  the  House  overwhelmingly  earlier  in  the  month  .  Sen.  Bradley  has  it  in  his  mind  that  such  a  tax  cut  would  unravel  the  tax  reform  he  helped  engineer  in  1986  .  But  he  knows  that  as  many  as  20  of  his  fellow  Democrats  are  disposed  to  vote  for  the  cut  ,  popular  among  their  constituents  . 
 As  a  result  ,  he  took  the  lead  in  arguing  that  the  cut  should  be  blocked  on  procedural  grounds  .  He  helped  persuade  10  of  these  senators  to  support  him  and  Majority  Leader  George  Mitchell  on  these  grounds  .  The  budget  reconciliation  had  to  be  dealt  with  by  the  Oct.  15  deadline  ,  and  these  Senate  Democrats  refused  to  agree  to  allow  a  vote  to  append  capital  gains  to  the  budget  bill  ,  knowing  it  would  pass  . 
 Denied  a  vote  on  substance  ,  the  GOP  leadership  in  the  Senate  on  Friday  morning  was  confronted  with  a  hard  choice  .  It  could  throw  in  the  towel  and  hope  to  win  on  capital  gains  late  this  month  ,  or  it  could  follow  the  White  House  strategy  ,  to  veto  reconciliation  unless  capital  gains  was  appended  . 
 The  U.S.  Chamber  of  Commerce  has  been  in  the  forefront  in  supporting  the  Bush  proposal  .  It  endorsed  the  White  House  strategy  ,  believing  it  to  be  the  surest  way  to  victory  .  At  noon  Friday  ,  a  senior  White  House  official  advised  Richard  Rahn  ,  the  Chamber  's  chief  economist  ,  that  the  White  House  would  not  agree  to  a  budget  reconciliation  bill  unless  it  had  firm  assurances  that  a  vote  on  substance  would  be  permitted  in  the  Senate  . 
 Two  hours  later  ,  the  first  word  emerged  on  Capitol  Hill  that  the  administration  had  agreed  to  reconciliation  with  no  such  assurances  from  Senate  Democrats  .  Mr.  Rahn  was  shocked  ,  telephoning  the  office  of  Richard  Darman  ,  director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  ,  and  the  administration  's  chief  strategist  on  this  issue  .  He  left  a  message  accusing  Mr.  Darman  of  selling  out  .  It  was  the  Senate  Republicans  ,  though  ,  who  had  edged  away  from  the  veto  strategy  . 
 The  stock  market  reacted  as  Mr.  Rahn  did  ,  crumbling  as  it  absorbed  the  news  that  Mr.  Darman  's  strategy  had  been  abandoned  .  The  stock  market  ,  after  all  ,  represents  the  collective  expectations  about  the  value  of  the  future  income  stream  of  the  nation  's  capital  stock  ,  discounted  to  present  value  . 
 Why  should  it  be  so  surprising  that  a  30  %  cut  in  the  capital-gains  tax  would  have  such  an  enormous  impact  on  the  value  of  the  nation  's  capital  stock  ?  The  total  value  of  privately  held  assets  is  easily  more  than  $  15  trillion  .  The  value  traded  on  the  exchanges  is  close  to  $  3  trillion  . 
 If  the  tax  on  any  gain  to  those  assets  was  doubled  ,  would  n't  the  value  fall  to  the  owners  of  the  assets  ?  Is  n't  it  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  asset  you  own  would  be  worth  more  if  the  government  suddenly  announced  that  if  you  sold  it  ,  you  would  be  able  to  keep  30  %  more  of  its  gain  than  you  previously  believed  ?  Indeed  ,  the  stock  market  's  steady  advance  this  year  tracked  with  President  Bush  's  success  in  advancing  his  capital-gains  proposal  .  A  30  %  cut  in  this  year  's  capital  gains  alone  amounts  to  roughly  $  50  billion  .  We  're  talking  real  money  . 
 When  Richard  Rahn  advised  the  financial  press  that  the  market  crash  was  caused  by  the  setback  to  capital  gains  ,  he  was  generally  ignored  and  mildly  ridiculed  .  Instead  ,  the  press  corps  readily  accepted  the  notion  that  a  snag  in  the  takeover  financing  of  United  Airlines  instantly  knocked  7  %  off  the  value  of  the  nation  's  capital  stock  and  caused  convulsions  around  the  world  .  Mr.  Rahn  was  pointing  out  an  elephant  rumbling  through  Wall  Street  while  conventional  wisdom  had  fastened  on  the  UAL  flea  . 
 Why  is  this  happening  ?  For  one  thing  ,  quite  a  number  of  the  leading  spokesmen  on  Wall  Street  are  not  portfolio  managers  ,  who  understand  that  the  value  of  assets  is  greatly  affected  by  how  government  taxes  those  assets  .  They  are  economists  and  financial  reporters  who  sympathize  with  the  view  that  a  capital-gains  tax  cut  benefits  the  rich  .  Yet  they  somehow  think  that  Wall  Street  is  indifferent  to  losing  the  tax  cut  that  seemed  so  close  Friday  morning  and  is  now  problematic  .  The  market  rebound  Monday  followed  weekend  assurances  from  Mr.  Darman  that  the  administration  has  other  plans  to  win  the  cut  ,  which  is  alive  and  well  . 
 Sen.  Bradley  's  argument  is  that  a  capital-gains  tax  cut  would  be  bad  for  the  economy  in  the  longer  run  .  It  would  inevitably  lead  to  an  increase  in  marginal  income-tax  rates  in  1990  ,  he  thinks  ,  when  the  White  House  is  forced  to  ask  for  higher  taxes  to  meet  budget  targets  .  That  is  ,  with  capital  gains  cut  ,  the  glue  of  the  1986  accord  will  be  gone  ,  and  political  realities  will  push  up  income-tax  rates  .  The  counter-argument  ,  which  he  has  heard  ,  is  that  if  he  and  his  fellow  Democrats  are  successful  in  killing  the  president  's  proposal  ,  the  revenue  gap  will  open  up  tremendously  in  1990  because  of  the  weakened  economy  .  In  this  atmosphere  ,  there  would  be  no  serious  consideration  of  tax  increases  .  If  Sen.  Bradley  would  permit  a  vote  on  capital  gains  ,  though  ,  it  would  pass  ,  Christmas  retail  sales  would  be  strong  instead  of  burdened  by  a  falling  stock  market  ,  the  1990  economy  would  be  robust  ,  and  the  revenue  gains  at  every  level  of  government  ,  including  New  Jersey  's  ,  would  be  surprisingly  high  .  No  tax  increases  would  be  necessary  . 
 The  struggle  over  capital  gains  is  the  most  important  game  in  town  .  In  Washington  and  on  Wall  Street  .

 Federal  prosecutors  said  they  have  obtained  a  guilty  plea  from  another  person  in  the  government  's  ongoing  probe  of  illegal  payments  in  the  record  industry  . 
 William  Craig  ,  an  independent  record  promoter  ,  pleaded  guilty  to  payola  and  criminal  tax  charges  ,  according  to  a  statement  issued  by  Gary  Feess  ,  the  U.S.  attorney  here  .  Payola  is  the  practice  of  making  illegal  ,  undisclosed  payments  to  radio  station  personnel  in  return  for  getting  the  stations  to  play  certain  songs  over  the  air  . 
 As  part  of  his  plea  agreement  with  the  government  ,  the  44-year-old  Mr.  Craig  faces  a  maximum  of  three  years  in  prison  .  In  return  ,  Mr.  Craig  agreed  to  cooperate  in  the  government  's  continuing  payola  probe  ,  says  a  spokeswoman  for  the  U.S.  attorney  's  office  . 
 Mr.  Craig  and  three  others  were  indicted  last  year  as  part  of  that  payola  probe  .  Two  other  defendants  previously  pleaded  guilty  ,  and  charges  against  the  third  were  dropped  .

 The  Tennessee  Valley  Authority  issued  $  4  billion  in  bonds  in  the  federal  utility  's  first  public  debt  offering  in  15  years  . 
 Proceeds  from  the  bonds  ,  with  coupon  rates  in  the  8  %  range  ,  will  be  used  to  replace  bonds  with  an  average  interest  rate  of  13.1  %  .  The  TVA  said  the  refinancing  should  save  $  75  million  a  year  in  interest  payments  . 
 The  refinancing  is  part  of  the  TVA  's  strategy  of  dealing  with  what  has  been  an  intractable  problem  :  its  staggering  $  18.5  billion  debt  ,  most  of  which  is  owed  to  the  Treasury  Department  's  Federal  Financing  Bank  .  The  TVA  currently  plans  to  issue  a  total  of  $  6.7  billion  in  bonds  to  refinance  its  high-interest  debt  . 
 The  $  4  billion  bond  issue  also  will  help  the  TVA  meet  its  goal  of  not  raising  rates  for  another  year  ,  said  William  F.  Malec  ,  the  agency  's  chief  financial  officer  . 
 The  bond  issue  is  TVA  's  first  public  offering  since  the  Financing  Bank  was  created  in  1974  ,  primarily  to  finance  the  TVA  .  But  the  offering  almost  did  n't  happen  .  The  TVA  ,  in  fact  ,  decided  to  proceed  with  the  bond  offering  following  an  agreement  last  week  with  the  Financing  Bank  ,  which  allows  TVA  to  keep  borrowing  short  term  from  the  bank  for  two  years  after  it  goes  to  the  public  market  .  The  Treasury  contended  that  TVA  could  n't  borrow  from  both  it  and  the  public  debt  market  . 
 The  $  4  billion  in  bonds  break  down  as  follows  :  $  1  billion  in  five-year  bonds  with  a  coupon  rate  of  8.25  %  and  a  yield  to  maturity  of  8.33  %  ;  $  1  billion  in  10-year  bonds  with  a  coupon  rate  of  8.375  %  and  a  yield  to  maturity  of  8.42  %  ;  $  2  billion  in  30-year  bonds  with  five-year  call  protection  ,  a  coupon  rate  of  8.75  %  and  a  yield  to  maturity  of  9.06  %  .  Managing  the  bond  issue  is  a  group  of  investment  banks  headed  by  First  Boston  Corp.  and  co-managed  by  Goldman  ,  Sachs  &  Co.  ,  Merrill  Lynch  Capital  Markets  ,  Morgan  Stanley  &  Co.  ,  and  Salomon  Brothers  Inc  . 
 Mutual-fund  czar  John  M.  Templeton  has  put  his  money  where  his  moniker  is  ,  pouring  $  1.4  million  into  one  of  his  own  funds  ,  the  Templeton  Value  Fund  . 
 Mr.  Templeton  owns  shares  in  several  of  the  33  funds  that  his  firm  manages  ,  but  only  in  three  of  the  10  available  to  U.S.  investors  ,  according  to  filings  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  .  Those  are  Templeton  Global  Income  ,  Templeton  Emerging  Markets  and  now  the  Value  Fund  . 
 Why  did  he  add  the  Value  Fund  to  the  list  ?  Because  he  's  very  bullish  on  the  emerging  growth  stocks  that  make  up  the  fund  's  portfolio  ,  Mr.  Templeton  said  from  his  Bahamas  hideaway  . 
 ``  Emerging  growth  stocks  have  n't  been  popular  in  America  for  years  ,  they  've  been  neglected  ,  ''  he  said  ,  and  their  prices  often  trail  the  market  as  a  whole  . 
 Mr.  Templeton  's  147,300-share  purchase  in  the  closed-end  fund  came  before  the  U.S.  stock  market  's  plunge  last  Friday  ,  but  still  proved  slightly  profitable  . 
 Mr.  Templeton  bought  his  shares  in  several  separate  purchases  between  Aug.  30  and  Sept.  28  ,  according  to  reports  with  the  SEC  .  He  bought  at  share  prices  ranging  from  $  9.375  to  $  9.625  .  The  fund  closed  yesterday  in  New  York  Stock  Exchange  composite  trading  at  $  9.625  ,  up  12.5  cents  . 
 In  addition  ,  Mr.  Templeton  received  a  dividend  of  22  cents  a  share  Oct.  5  .

 INTEREST-RATE  PLAYER  :  Cincinnati  Gas  &  Electric  Co.  tops  the  companies  portion  of  the  accompanying  Insider  Trading  table  this  week  .  Three  of  the  utility  's  directors  have  at  least  doubled  their  holdings  in  the  company  since  July  . 
 The  largest  purchase  was  by  Dudley  Taft  ,  who  bought  4,400  shares  for  $  125,075  .  Mr.  Taft  ,  who  is  also  president  of  Taft  Broadcasting  Co.  ,  said  he  bought  the  shares  because  he  keeps  a  utility  account  at  the  brokerage  firm  of  Salomon  Brothers  Inc.  ,  which  had  recommended  the  stock  as  a  good  buy  .  Salomon  Brothers  confirmed  that  it  has  had  a  buy  recommendation  on  the  stock  for  about  two  years  . 
 ``  Cincinnati  Gas  &  Electric  is  in  good  shape  ,  ''  Mr.  Taft  said  ,  and  utilities  are  ``  a  good  investment  because  interest  rates  are  going  down  .  '' 
 Mr.  Taft  paid  an  average  of  $  28.43  for  each  share  .  The  stock  closed  yesterday  on  the  Big  Board  at  $  28.75  ,  down  12.5  cents  . 
 The  two  other  directors  bought  1,000  and  1,900  shares  ,  respectively  ,  at  prices  between  $  28.15  a  share  and  $  28.75  a  share  ,  filings  with  the  SEC  show  .  The  two  could  n't  be  reached  for  comment  .  A  company  spokesman  said  he  could  n't  explain  their  sudden  bullishness  .  ``  I  do  n't  know  of  any  news  or  anything  unusual  happening  here  ,  ''  said  Bruce  Stoecklin  ,  director  of  media  services  .

 In  one  of  the  first  indoor  air-pollution  cases  to  go  to  trial  ,  a  state-court  jury  decided  in  favor  of  the  defendant  ,  Burlington  Industries  Inc  . 
 The  verdict  ,  reached  late  last  week  in  Cincinnati  ,  may  end  an  eight-year  legal  battle  for  the  Greensboro  ,  N.C.  ,  carpet  maker  . 
 Glenn  and  Sharon  Beebe  of  Cincinnati  had  sued  the  com  -  pany  in  1981  after  installing  Burlington  carpets  in  their  office  .  The  Beebes  alleged  that  toxic  fumes  from  the  carpets  made  them  sick  .  As  a  result  of  their  illness  ,  the  Beebes  said  ,  they  lost  $  1.8  million  in  wages  and  earnings  .  In  addition  ,  they  said  that  months  of  exposure  to  the  chemicals  has  left  them  sensitive  to  a  wide  range  of  commonly  used  substances  . 
 The  case  had  been  closely  watched  because  attorneys  anticipate  increasing  litigation  nationally  over  the  so-called  sick-building  syndrome  .  Plaintiffs  '  lawyers  say  that  buildings  become  ``  sick  ''  when  inadequate  fresh  air  and  poor  ventilation  systems  lead  pollutants  to  build  up  inside  . 
 Anthony  J.  Iaciofano  ,  a  lawyer  for  Burlington  ,  said  the  company  believes  the  Beebes  '  symptoms  were  not  related  to  the  carpeting  .  He  said  that  ill  effects  from  new  carpets  manifest  themselves  immediately  but  that  the  Beebes  '  symptoms  appeared  months  later  . 
 Catherine  Adams  ,  the  Beebes  '  lawyer  ,  said  the  verdict  would  not  discourage  other  plaintiffs  from  filing  such  suits  .  Scientists  are  only  beginning  to  understand  what  causes  sick-building  syndrome  and  much  of  that  research  was  unavailable  when  the  Beebes  filed  the  case  ,  she  said  . 
 The  Beebes  now  believe  that  a  prime  culprit  for  their  injuries  was  fumes  from  an  adhesive  used  in  the  carpeting  .  But  the  Beebes  did  n't  come  to  that  conclusion  until  time  limits  had  elapsed  for  adding  the  adhesives  maker  as  a  defendant  in  the  case  ,  Ms.  Adams  said  . 
 The  Beebes  have  not  yet  decided  whether  to  appeal  . 
 TIMES  SQUARE  development  opponents  are  dealt  setback  . 
 The  Appellate  Division  of  New  York  State  Supreme  Court  dismissed  six  lawsuits  attempting  to  block  a  $  2.5  billion  project  planned  for  42nd  Street  in  Manhattan  . 
 Opponents  of  the  project  had  claimed  that  the  city  and  the  state  of  New  York  ,  which  are  co-sponsoring  the  project  ,  had  failed  to  adhere  to  environmental  guidelines  . 
 All  but  two  of  the  40  or  so  lawsuits  that  have  been  filed  since  the  project  's  1984  approval  have  been  dismissed  before  the  trial  stage  .  The  two  that  remain  have  n't  yet  reached  the  pre-trial  fact-finding  stage  . 
 State  officials  said  the  court  's  ruling  clears  the  way  for  proceedings  to  condemn  buildings  in  the  area  .  ``  This  project  is  ready  to  move  ,  ''  said  State  Urban  Development  Corp.  Chairman  Vincent  Tese  . 
 But  developers  of  four  planned  office  towers  cautioned  that  obstacles  still  remain  .  As  part  of  the  agreement  with  the  state  ,  the  developers  --  a  partnership  of  Park  Tower  Realty  and  Prudential  Insurance  Co.  of  America  --  said  they  would  not  proceed  with  condemnation  proceedings  while  there  was  ``  significant  litigation  ''  pending  . 
 Park  Tower  General  Counsel  Matthew  Mayer  said  the  development  team  will  have  to  review  two  additional  lawsuits  before  putting  up  a  $  155  million  letter  of  credit  to  cover  condemnation  costs  .  Also  ,  he  said  ,  the  partnership  is  waiting  to  see  whether  the  appellate  division  's  ruling  will  be  appealed  . 
 The  plan  ,  which  has  been  plagued  with  delays  and  business-related  setbacks  ,  seeks  to  transform  the  area  from  a  seedy  thoroughfare  to  a  more  wholesome  office  and  theater  district  . 
 State  and  city  officials  are  still  negotiating  with  developers  to  renovate  historic  theaters  and  build  and  operate  a  merchandise  mart  and  hotel  . 
 FEDERAL  JUDGE  EXPANDS  role  of  U.S.  courts  in  extradition  decisions  . 
 U.S.  District  Judge  Jack  B.  Weinstein  of  Brooklyn  ,  N.Y.  ,  ruled  that  a  man  implicated  in  an  attack  on  an  Israeli  passenger  bus  in  1986  can  be  extradited  to  Israel  for  trial  . 
 A  magistrate  had  initially  refused  the  request  ,  ruling  that  the  attack  had  been  a  political  act  for  which  the  man  ,  Mahmoud  El-Abed  Ahmad  ,  would  be  exempt  from  extradition  .  However  ,  Judge  Weinstein  wrote  in  his  opinion  late  last  month  that  terrorism  and  acts  of  war  against  civilians  can  not  be  defined  as  political  acts  . 
 Judge  Weinstein  also  ruled  that  judges  must  consider  prior  to  extradition  whether  the  defendant  will  be  treated  fairly  in  a  foreign  court  .  To  do  so  ,  the  judge  said  ,  the  U.S.  courts  must  review  the  judicial  process  in  the  foreign  country  independently  of  the  State  Department  's  assessment  .  He  said  that  in  this  case  he  concurred  with  the  State  Department  's  decision  that  Mr.  Ahmad  should  be  extradited  .  Mr.  Ahmad  's  lawyer  said  he  would  appeal  . 
 Lawyers  close  to  the  case  said  they  believed  the  ruling  was  unprecedented  . 
 ``  Up  until  now  the  courts  have  said  it  is  not  their  role  to  supervise  the  foreign  country  's  courts  ,  ''  said  Jacques  Semmelman  ,  the  assistant  U.S.  attorney  on  the  case  .

 QUOTABLE  :  In  a  speech  prepared  for  delivery  in  New  York  yesterday  ,  retired  Justice  Lewis  Powell  contested  the  notion  that  the  last  Supreme  Court  term  marked  a  turn  toward  conservatism  :  ``  Commentators  who  agreed  on  little  else  unanimously  proclaimed  a  `  shift  in  direction  '  on  the  court  ...  .  I  take  these  pronouncements  ,  like  many  that  have  preceded  them  in  past  years  ,  with  a  grain  of  salt  .  In  an  era  of  `  sound  bites  '  and  instant  opinion  polls  it  is  dangerous  to  apply  broad  labels  to  a  single  term  .  '' 

 (  During  its  centennial  year  ,  The  Wall  Street  Journal  will  report  events  of  the  past  century  that  stand  as  milestones  of  American  business  history  .  ) 
 THE  YOM  KIPPUR  WAR  ,  WHEN  EGYPT  CRASHED  into  Israel  on  Oct.  6  ,  1973  ,  the  holiest  day  in  the  Jewish  calendar  ,  lasted  barely  a  month  .  But  one  far-afield  effect  is  still  with  us  . 
 The  Arab  states  ,  always  bitterly  resentful  of  U.S.  support  toward  Israel  ,  realized  they  held  an  irresistable  weapon  --  oil  .  Early  in  October  ,  six  Arab  nations  in  the  Persian  Gulf  jacked  up  prices  sharply  .  On  Oct.  22  ,  led  by  Saudi  Arabia  ,  the  world  's  largest  exporter  ,  they  embargoed  oil  shipments  to  the  U.S.  and  to  the  Netherlands  ,  Israel  's  staunchest  European  ally  . 
 The  timing  was  perfect  .  The  Arabs  had  tried  embargos  before  .  In  1956  ,  when  Britain  ,  France  and  Israel  invaded  Egypt  to  seize  the  Suez  Canal  ,  Arab  producers  cut  off  supplies  to  Europe  .  Texas  simply  pumped  harder  . 
 U.S.  oil  supplies  ,  however  ,  had  peaked  in  1970  and  1971  and  by  1973  were  declining  .  Imports  ,  then  six  million  barrels  a  day  ,  came  primarily  from  Venezuela  and  Canada  .  But  Middle  East  supplies  were  growing  in  importance  .  By  1973  ,  the  U.S.  was  bringing  in  two  million  barrels  of  Arab  oil  a  day  ,  more  than  10  %  of  the  17.3  million  barrels  consumed  daily  . 
 Politics  and  economics  conspired  .  Japan  and  Europe  ,  far  more  dependent  on  Mideast  oil  than  the  U.S.  ,  would  n't  offend  the  Arabs  or  trade  off  their  precious  supplies  .  The  U.S.  did  manage  to  supply  the  Dutch  with  oil  by  relabeling  supplies  ;  once  oil  is  shipped  ,  no  one  can  tell  its  source  . 
 But  car-happy  Americans  panicked  ,  and  so  did  the  U.S.  and  other  oil-consuming  governments  .  ``  Shortage  ''  and  ``  crisis  ''  became  buzz  words  ,  although  neither  really  applied  .  The  spot  dislocations  that  showed  up  were  largely  the  result  of  confusion  (  much  of  it  in  Washington  )  ,  though  that  was  cold  comfort  for  drivers  waiting  in  mile-long  lines  at  the  gas  pumps  . 
 The  embargo  lasted  only  six  months  ,  but  the  price  hikes  became  a  fact  of  life  .  What  the  Arabs  started  ,  inflation  finished  .  Once  and  for  all  ,  $  5-a-barrel  crude  oil  and  35-cents-a-gallon  gasoline  were  history  . 
 Times  may  be  tough  on  Wall  Street  for  some  ,  but  a  few  bosses  are  making  as  much  as  ever  --  or  more  . 
 At  Bear  Stearns  Cos.  ,  for  example  ,  the  15  executive  officers  led  by  Chairman  Alan  ``  Ace  ''  Greenberg  got  a  pay  increase  to  $  35.9  million  for  the  14-month  period  ended  June  30  from  $  22.9  million  for  the  12  months  ended  April  30  ,  1988  .  The  figures  do  n't  include  substantial  dividends  on  holdings  of  Bear  Stearns  stock  .  Mr.  Greenberg  himself  was  paid  $  4.5  million  ,  before  an  estimated  $  1.5  million  in  dividends  ,  up  from  $  2.4  million  the  year  before  . 
 The  increase  is  noted  in  the  brokerage  firm  's  latest  proxy  statement  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  .  Because  it  operates  on  a  fiscal  year  ,  Bear  Stearns  's  yearly  filings  are  available  much  earlier  than  those  of  other  firms  .  The  latest  period  includes  14  months  instead  of  12  because  Bear  Stearns  changed  to  a  fiscal  year  ending  in  June  instead  of  April  . 
 Meanwhile  ,  Bear  Stearns  's  650  stock  and  bond  salesmen  saw  thinner  paychecks  over  the  past  year  ,  which  the  company  says  reflected  lower  commission  revenue  caused  by  a  decline  in  investor  activity  in  the  markets  .  However  ,  Bear  Stearns  on  Monday  reported  improved  earnings  for  its  first  quarter  ,  ended  Sept.  29  ,  partly  because  of  a  31  %  increase  in  commissions  during  the  quarter  . 
 William  J.  Montgoris  ,  chief  financial  officer  ,  defended  the  lofty  salaries  at  Bear  Stearns  .  ``  All  of  us  are  on  a  base  salary  of  $  200,000  if  the  firm  makes  nothing  --  and  that  's  pretty  low  as  far  as  Wall  Street  goes  ,  ''  Mr.  Montgoris  said  .  However  ,  Bear  Stearns  has  never  had  an  unprofitable  year  since  its  founding  65  years  ago  . 
 Four  Bear  Stearns  executives  besides  the  62-year-old  Mr.  Greenberg  were  paid  $  3  million  or  more  before  dividends  for  the  14  months  ended  in  June  . 
 According  to  the  proxy  statement  ,  James  E.  Cayne  ,  55  ,  Bear  Stearns  's  president  ,  made  $  3.9  million  ;  an  executive  vice  president  ,  Michael  L.  Tarnopol  ,  53  ,  made  nearly  $  3.4  million  ;  and  two  executive  vice  presidents  ,  Vincent  J.  Mattone  ,  44  ,  and  William  J.  Michaelcheck  ,  42  ,  made  about  $  3.3  million  each  . 
 Mr.  Montgoris  said  the  firm  has  a  ``  straight  mathematical  formula  ''  for  determining  compensation  ,  based  on  the  firm  's  earnings  .  ``  Just  because  a  particular  element  of  the  firm  is  down  ,  ''  such  as  stockbrokerage  ,  ``  does  n't  mean  the  executive  committee  should  be  paid  less  ,  ''  he  said  . 
 Morgan  Grenfell  Group  PLC  said  John  Craven  ,  group  chief  executive  officer  ,  is  taking  over  the  chairmanship  of  the  merchant  banking  group  from  Sir  Peter  Carey  ,  who  is  retiring  . 
 Mr.  Carey  will  remain  a  member  of  the  merchant  bank  's  board  . 
 Mr.  Craven  is  widely  credited  with  refocusing  Morgan  Grenfell  's  energies  on  its  core  corporate  finance  ,  fund  management  and  banking  activities  over  the  past  year  .  Last  year  ,  Morgan  Grenfell  shut  down  its  ailing  U.K.  securities  operations  . 
 Mr.  Craven  said  his  move  to  the  chairmanship  means  he  will  take  a  less  active  role  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  the  group  ,  but  he  added  that  the  merchant  bank  's  strategic  focus  remains  unchanged  . 
 Mr.  Craven  joined  Morgan  Grenfell  as  group  chief  executive  in  May  1987  ,  a  few  months  after  the  resignations  of  former  Chief  Executive  Christopher  Reeves  and  other  top  officials  because  of  the  merchant  bank  's  role  in  Guinness  PLC  's  controversial  takeover  of  Distiller  's  Co.  in  1986  . 
 Morgan  Grenfell  had  advised  Guinness  on  the  bid  ,  which  was  surrounded  by  allegations  that  Guinness  used  artificial  means  to  support  the  bid  's  value  . 
 Morgan  Grenfell  said  Michael  Dobson  ,  currently  group  deputy  chief  executive  ,  will  assume  the  chief  executive  position  . 
 The  merchant  bank  also  announced  that  finance  director  David  Eward  is  taking  early  retirement  for  personal  reasons  .  His  duties  will  be  taken  over  by  Anthony  Richmond-Watson  ,  who  has  been  elected  deputy  chairman  . 
 News  of  Mr.  Eward  's  retirement  comes  one  day  after  Morgan  said  that  Christopher  Whittington  resigned  as  chairman  of  Morgan  's  banking  subsidiary  to  join  a  financial  services  firm  . 
 Mr.  Craven  said  both  Messrs.  Eward  and  Whittington  had  planned  to  leave  the  bank  earlier  ,  but  Mr.  Craven  had  persuaded  them  to  remain  until  the  bank  was  in  a  healthy  position  .  ``  If  there  's  any  coincidence  about  the  departures  it  's  that  they  are  leaving  at  a  time  when  the  business  is  in  reasonably  good  shape  and  going  forward  very  well  .  ''  Last  month  ,  Morgan  Grenfell  announced  its  pretax  profit  rose  49.6  %  to  #  32.8  million  in  the  first  half  ,  boosted  by  a  healthy  growth  in  its  domestic  and  international  corporate  finance  business  .

 Par  Pharmaceutical  Inc.  said  it  named  its  interim  president  and  chief  executive  officer  ,  Kenneth  I.  Sawyer  ,  to  those  posts  permanently  ,  and  elected  him  to  the  board  . 
 Par  also  said  it  was  advised  by  the  U.S.  attorney  for  Maryland  that  it  is  one  of  a  number  of  companies  being  investigated  by  a  federal  grand  jury  for  alleged  violations  of  the  federal  Food  ,  Drug  and  Cosmetic  Act  .  Par  ,  a  generic-drug  maker  that  has  been  plagued  by  management  problems  ,  was  already  the  subject  of  a  federal  criminal  inquiry  into  the  drug-approval  process  and  a  Food  and  Drug  Administration  investigation  . 
 A  Par  spokesman  said  he  understood  the  criminal  investigation  in  Maryland  relates  to  matters  Par  disclosed  in  July  ,  when  Par  said  it  filed  false  drug  information  with  the  FDA  .  At  the  time  ,  the  company  said  it  was  recalling  one  of  its  drugs  and  had  stopped  selling  two  others  .  The  spokesman  said  he  also  understood  that  the  inquiry  related  to  the  existence  of  an  ``  off-the-record  ''  production  book  .  The  book  noted  changes  made  at  the  manufacturing  level  that  were  n't  disclosed  to  the  FDA  . 
 Par  said  it  is  cooperating  in  the  investigation  . 
 Also  yesterday  ,  Ashok  Patel  ,  a  former  Par  official  who  pleaded  guilty  to  providing  an  FDA  employee  an  illegal  gratuity  of  $  3,000  ,  was  sentenced  by  a  federal  judge  in  Baltimore  to  one  year  of  community  service  and  a  $  150,000  fine  .  Mr.  Patel  also  was  placed  on  three  years  '  probation  .  Mr.  Patel  resigned  as  senior  vice  president  of  Par  in  April  .  In  July  ,  Par  and  a  60%-owned  unit  agreed  to  plead  guilty  in  that  inquiry  ,  as  did  another  former  Par  official  . 
 Mr.  Sawyer  began  running  the  company  on  an  interim  basis  in  late  September  .  Par  said  it  selected  him  for  the  posts  of  president  and  chief  executive  on  a  permanent  basis  because  of  his  experience  in  the  industry  and  his  performance  at  Par  .  Perry  Levine  ,  chairman  ,  said  Mr.  Sawyer  had  ``  taken  significant  steps  ''  to  restore  the  company  's  credibility  and  sense  of  professionalism  and  integrity  . 
 Just  after  midnight  Monday  ,  federal  spending  started  to  drop  by  $  16  billion  .  What  do  you  say  we  all  close  down  the  poker  game  ,  go  home  and  bank  the  $  16  billion  ? 
 That  's  essentially  what  budget  director  Richard  Darman  is  suggesting  ,  and  we  think  he  deserves  as  much  support  as  he  can  get  .  If  human  beings  ca  n't  cut  federal  spending  honestly  --  and  they  ca  n't  --  let  the  computers  do  it  . 
 Congress  ,  with  a  measure  of  White  House  complicity  ,  has  been  manipulating  the  spending  accounts  for  years  under  the  cover  of  omnibus  appropriations  bills  .  (  Indeed  without  earlier  manipulations  ,  the  current  sequester  of  $  16  billion  would  have  been  even  larger  .  )  We  suspect  voters  are  fed  up  with  the  finagling  .  Consider  ,  for  instance  ,  that  even  yesterday  's  widely  publicized  sequester  is  likely  to  be  traduced  if  business  as  usual  is  allowed  to  prevail  . 
 Under  the  law  ,  Gramm-Rudman  's  across-the-board-cuts  in  federal  programs  are  supposed  to  be  permanent  .  Social  Security  and  spending  for  poor  people  are  exempted  .  However  ,  the  Associated  Press  's  account  of  the  Monday  sequester  order  signed  by  President  Bush  neatly  captured  the  contempt  Congress  shows  toward  the  notion  of  a  legally  binding  commitment  :  ``  Lawmakers  have  been  saying  for  weeks  that  they  plan  to  roll  back  the  cuts  as  soon  as  they  agree  to  a  compromise  on  a  deficit-cutting  bill  .  '' 
 Mr.  Darman  's  inclination  to  save  the  sequester  was  backed  up  yesterday  by  White  House  Press  Secretary  Marlin  Fitzwater  :  ``  There  is  some  feeling  here  that  the  cuts  are  the  way  to  go  .  It  will  reduce  spending  in  a  very  effective  fashion  .  ''  This  attitude  is  being  waved  away  by  sophisticates  around  Washington  as  little  more  than  tough  talk  .  It  looks  to  us  like  a  golden  opportunity  for  George  Bush  to  chop  off  at  the  knees  all  this  talk  about  a  timid  ,  unserious  presidency  .  Mr.  Bush  would  be  acting  in  the  public  interest  if  he  let  the  Washington  elites  who  manipulate  these  budgets  --  the  bureaucrats  ,  the  lobbyists  ,  the  congressional  staffers  --  live  for  just  one  year  on  a  restricted  diet  .  Ask  Tommy  Lasorda  ;  thin  is  in  .  Senator  Phil  Gramm  pointed  out  Monday  that  in  the  20  years  before  Gramm-Rudman  was  enacted  in  1985  ,  federal  spending  grew  by  about  11  %  a  year  ;  since  the  law  ,  it  's  grown  at  under  5  %  annually  .  Another  major  factor  in  this  positive  trend  was  Ronald  Reagan  's  decision  early  in  his  presidency  to  fight  the  budget  war  on  the  expenditure  side  rather  than  raising  taxes  . 
 George  Bush  's  continued  support  of  the  tax  dam  sustains  this  strategy  of  pressuring  Congress  to  make  choices  among  competing  priorities  ,  rather  than  just  saying  yes  to  all  the  grateful  special-interest  constituencies  that  fill  the  PAC  trough  .  If  Washington  's  elites  ever  succeed  in  bursting  the  tax  dam  ,  Americans  will  be  engulfed  in  a  red  sea  of  new  spending  programs  ,  such  as  federalized  child  care  . 
 Child  care  was  one  of  the  many  ``  extraneous  ''  bills  pulled  out  of  the  Senate  's  reconciliation  bill  last  Friday  .  Others  were  the  capital-gains  cut  ,  Section  89  repeal  ,  the  disabled  workers  bill  ,  and  the  unprecedented  reconsideration  of  the  catastrophic  health  act  .  All  this  stuff  still  is  in  the  House  's  1,878-page  reconciliation  bill  ,  and  many  Members  say  they  're  reluctant  to  pull  out  cherished  bills  ,  just  to  see  them  die  .  Republicans  especially  want  a  guarantee  from  the  House  leadership  that  they  'll  get  an  up-or-down  vote  on  the  bills  . 
 House  Speaker  Foley  ought  to  deliver  that  promise  .  This  is  the  way  government  is  supposed  to  work  ,  with  politicians  taking  responsibility  for  votes  that  their  constituents  can  identify  ,  instead  of  concealing  them  in  the  great  reconciliation  garbage  truck  . 
 We  have  as  much  nostalgia  as  anyone  for  those  leafy  ,  breezy  days  in  Washington  when  honorable  men  and  women  dickered  over  budgets  and  even  log-rolled  a  bit  to  see  that  the  bridges  got  build  ,  roads  paved  ,  soldiers  paid  or  that  the  desperately  poor  were  cared  for  .  Those  days  are  gone  .  Nor  do  we  see  any  reason  to  believe  that  a  metropolitan  Washington  that  has  gotten  fat  and  rich  and  lazy  in  the  shadow  of  the  federal  colossus  will  change  much  on  its  own  initiative  . 
 Save  the  sequester  ,  and  let  Washington  scream  . 
 The  New  York  Stock  Exchange  said  a  seat  sold  for  $  436,000  ,  down  $  39,000  from  the  previous  sale  Oct.  4  . 
 Seats  are  currently  quoted  at  $  425,000  bid  and  $  475,000  offered  . 
 The  $  475,000  sale  price  earlier  this  month  was  the  lowest  in  nearly  three  years  .  Exchange  seats  hit  a  peak  of  $  1,150,000  in  September  1987  . 
 The  Canadian  government  auctioned  750  million  Canadian  dollars  (  US$  637.5  million  )  of  9.25  %  bonds  due  Dec.  15  ,  1994  . 
 The  average  accepted  yield  bid  was  9.617  %  for  a  price  equivalent  of  98.523  . 
 Proceeds  of  the  sale  will  be  used  to  redeem  C$  675  million  of  government  bonds  maturing  Nov.  1  and  for  general  government  purposes  . 
 Northern  Trust  Corp.  said  its  board  adopted  a  shareholder  rights  plan  aimed  at  deterring  unwanted  takeover  bids  ,  but  said  it  's  not  aware  of  any  plan  to  acquire  the  banking  concern  . 
 Under  Northern  Trust  's  plan  ,  shareholders  were  issued  rights  that  ,  in  the  event  of  certain  attempted  takeovers  ,  allow  holders  to  buy  shares  in  the  company  at  half  price  . 
 National  Patent  Development  Corp.  said  it  plans  to  purchase  as  many  as  200,000  common  shares  of  its  81%-controlled  Interferon  Sciences  Inc.  unit  in  periodic  ,  open-market  purchases  . 
 The  200,000  shares  are  about  23  %  of  Interferon  's  common  shares  outstanding  ,  excluding  National  Patent  's  stake  . 
 Noting  the  recent  Food  and  Drug  Administration  approval  of  Interferon  's  genital  warts  treatment  ,  National  Patent  said  it  believes  Interferon  's  stock  is  undervalued  . 
 Japanese  investors  ,  reassured  by  Monday  's  strong  rally  on  Wall  Street  ,  erased  most  of  that  day  's  losses  on  the  Tokyo  Stock  Exchange  .  But  analysts  said  the  rebound  did  n't  remove  the  cautious  mood  from  the  market  . 
 In  London  ,  stocks  closed  lower  in  volatile  trading  as  an  opening  rally  was  obliterated  by  worse-than-expected  U.S.  trade  figures  .  Paris  shares  had  a  similar  reaction  ,  but  most  other  European  bourses  posted  gains  ,  as  did  all  major  Asian  and  Pacific  stock  markets  . 
 Tokyo  's  Nikkei  Index  of  225  stocks  jumped  527.39  points  to  close  at  34996.08  .  The  rise  came  a  day  after  the  year  's  biggest  drop  on  Monday  ,  when  the  Nikkei  fell  647.33  ,  or  1.8  %  ,  in  response  to  Friday  's  6.9  %  plunge  on  Wall  Street  . 
 In  early  trading  Wednesday  in  Tokyo  ,  the  Nikkei  index  rose  19.30  points  to  35015.38  . 
 On  Tuesday  ,  the  broader-based  Tokyo  Stock  Price  Index  of  issues  listed  in  the  first  section  ,  which  fell  45.66  Monday  ,  rose  41.76  ,  or  1.61  %  ,  to  2642.64  .  Trading  was  relatively  thin  at  an  estimated  650  million  shares  ,  though  brisker  than  Monday  's  526  million  .  Advancing  issues  outnumbered  decliners  821-201  ,  with  103  unchanged  . 
 ``  We  're  back  to  square  one  ,  ''  said  Simon  Smithson  ,  an  analyst  in  Japan  for  Kleinwort  Benson  International  Inc  . 
 Japanese  domestic  institutions  ,  including  trust  banks  and  investment  management  firms  ,  that  had  been  on  the  sidelines  during  Monday  's  fall  were  back  in  the  market  ,  analysts  said  .  Foreign  investors  reportedly  started  off  selling  but  later  joined  in  the  buying  . 
 The  Tokyo  rally  seemed  to  confirm  the  view  ,  frequently  expressed  in  Japan  in  the  past  few  days  ,  that  the  drop  in  New  York  was  a  local  problem  related  to  merger  and  acquisition  activity  in  the  U.S  . 
 ``  This  time  we  do  n't  really  have  to  worry  about  Tokyo  ,  ''  said  an  official  at  Daiwa  Securities  Co  .  ``  Nothing  has  changed  fundamentally  in  the  Tokyo  market  .  '' 
 But  even  though  Tokyo  appears  unharmed  by  recent  market  volatility  ,  analysts  and  traders  say  there  are  still  a  few  concerns  on  the  horizon  .  In  particular  ,  Japanese  investors  will  be  keeping  a  wary  eye  on  Wall  Street  to  see  whether  Monday  's  88.12-point  rally  holds  up  as  fresh  U.S.  economic  data  are  released  . 
 ``  People  are  placing  small  bets  .  There  's  no  huge  buying  ,  ''  said  Stephen  Hill  ,  head  of  equity  sales  at  Jardine  Fleming  Securities  Ltd.  in  Tokyo  .  ``  Really  brave  views  right  now  would  be  foolhardy  .  '' 
 Yesterday  's  buyers  favored  real  estate  ,  construction  and  other  large-capitalization  issues  ,  reflecting  the  fact  that  many  Tokyo  investors  now  feel  safer  with  domestically  oriented  stocks  ,  analysts  said  . 
 They  also  are  concerned  about  the  persistent  strength  of  the  dollar  against  the  yen  ,  as  a  weaker  yen  leads  to  higher  import  prices  in  Japan  and  adds  to  domestic  inflationary  pressures  . 
 Currency  concerns  also  weigh  heavily  on  interest  rate-sensitive  stocks  such  as  banking  and  other  financial  issues  because  of  fears  that  Japanese  interest  rates  might  have  to  rise  to  keep  the  dollar  in  check  . 
 Among  steel  shares  ,  NKK  rose  19  to  705  yen  (  $  4.97  )  a  share  ,  and  Nippon  Steel  gained  17  to  735  .  Construction  shares  that  gained  included  Shimizu  ,  which  rose  130  to  2,080  .  In  the  real  estate  sector  ,  Mitsui  Real  Estate  Development  was  up  100  at  2,760  ,  and  Mitsubishi  Estate  gained  80  to  2,360  . 
 London  's  Financial  Times-Stock  Exchange  100-share  index  fell  27.9  points  to  2135.5  .  It  was  down  more  than  40  points  a  half-hour  before  the  close  ,  marking  a  61.5-point  turnaround  from  its  high  ,  reached  in  the  first  15  minutes  of  trading  .  The  narrower  Financial  Times  30-share  index  fell  29.6  to  1730.7  .  Volume  was  an  active  643.3  million  shares  ,  about  double  the  recent  levels  but  down  from  959.3  million  the  previous  day  ,  which  U.K.  traders  have  dubbed  ``  Manic  Monday  .  '' 
 Prices  opened  strongly  on  the  basis  of  Monday  's  Wall  Street  rally  and  yesterday  's  gains  in  Tokyo  .  But  the  advance  faltered  as  index-options  traders  and  investors  jittery  about  the  U.K.  economic  outlook  took  over  .  The  unexpectedly  wide  U.S.  August  trade  deficit  of  $  10.77  billion  hit  an  already  jittery  U.K.  market  in  midafternoon  . 
 Michael  Hicks  ,  who  manages  sales  and  trading  for  brokerage  concern  Societe  Generale  Strauss  Turnbull  ,  said  :  ``  It  's  a  nervous  market  .  It  was  all  over  the  place  .  If  you  bought  ,  you  wish  you  had  n't  ,  and  if  you  sold  ,  you  wish  you  had  n't  .  ''  He  said  the  current  market  ``  is  all  about  sentiment  ,  and  the  sentiment  in  London  is  90  %  anxiety  and  worry  .  ''  Britain  's  economic  fundamentals  ,  he  said  ,  ``  do  n't  look  very  bright  .  '' 
 Dealers  said  London  showed  signs  of  calming  in  midafternoon  after  Wall  Street  avoided  sharp  losses  despite  the  trade  report  ,  but  a  wave  of  futures-related  selling  later  in  the  session  sent  buyers  back  to  the  sidelines  .  Still  ,  some  sectors  found  buying  interest  after  being  actively  sold  in  recent  weeks  . 
 Merchant  banks  were  stronger  across  the  board  .  Morgan  Grenfell  ,  which  has  been  mentioned  in  takeover  rumors  ,  rose  20  to  392  pence  (  $  6.18  )  a  share  .  S.G.  Warburg  ,  a  rumored  target  of  some  European  banking  concerns  ,  finished  22  higher  at  400  .  Hambros  rose  5  to  204  ,  and  Schroders  rose  25  to  #  12.75  . 
 On  the  corporate  front  ,  Ford  Motor  announced  that  it  raised  its  stake  in  U.K.  luxury  car  maker  Jaguar  to  10.4  %  from  5  %  .  Jaguar  shares  jumped  23  before  easing  to  close  at  654  ,  up  6  . 
 Amstrad  ,  a  British  computer  hardware  and  communications  equipment  maker  ,  eased  4  to  47  .  It  announced  a  52  %  plunge  in  pretax  profit  for  the  latest  year  . 
 Brewery  stocks  were  firm  to  higher  on  talk  of  early  bargain-hunting  ,  but  most  ended  below  their  peaks  .  Bass  ended  up  3  higher  at  966  ,  Guinness  closed  at  589  ,  down  7  ,  and  Scottish  &  Newcastle  dropped  11  to  359  ,  but  Whitbread  Class  A  shares  rose  17  to  363  .  Dealers  said  there  was  late  talk  of  a  Whitbread  sale  of  brewing  operations  to  Scottish  &  Newcastle  . 
 The  most  active  shares  were  major  blue-chips  ,  particularly  oils  and  utilities  such  as  British  Gas  and  British  Telecommunications  .  Traders  attributed  the  action  in  them  largely  to  defensive  positioning  in  a  volatile  market  .  British  Gas  finished  at  197  ,  down  2  ,  on  13  million  shares  ,  British  Petroleum  fell  8  to  291  on  9.4  million  shares  ,  and  British  Telecom  was  4  lower  at  261  on  turnover  of  10  million  shares  .  Cable  &  Wireless  fell  20  to  478  . 
 Also  in  active  trading  ,  British  Steel  fell  1  to  124  as  20  million  shares  changed  hands  .  Racal  Electric  ,  which  traded  11  million  shares  ,  declined  12  to  218  . 
 In  other  European  markets  ,  share  prices  closed  sharply  higher  in  Frankfurt  and  Zurich  and  posted  moderate  rises  in  Stockholm  ,  Amsterdam  and  Milan  .  Paris  closed  lower  ,  and  most  Brussels  shares  were  unable  to  trade  for  a  second  consecutive  day  because  of  technical  problems  .  South  African  gold  stocks  closed  higher  . 
 Elsewhere  ,  share  prices  rebounded  in  Hong  Kong  ,  Sydney  ,  Singapore  ,  Wellington  ,  Taipei  ,  Manila  and  Seoul  .  In  Hong  Kong  ,  Sydney  and  Singapore  --  the  largest  of  those  exchanges  --  stocks  recovered  one-third  to  one-half  of  the  ground  they  lost  in  Monday  's  plunge  ,  with  major  market  indexes  posting  gains  of  3.6  %  to  4.4  %  . 
 Here  are  price  trends  on  the  world  's  major  stock  markets  ,  as  calculated  by  Morgan  Stanley  Capital  International  Perspective  ,  Geneva  .

 Zurn  Industries  Inc.  said  it  received  approval  to  proceed  on  four  separate  projects  with  a  total  contract  value  of  $  59  million  . 
 The  projects  include  construction  of  a  29,400  kilowatt  waste-to-energy  plant  for  Ada  Cogeneration  L.P.  ,  Ada  ,  Mich.  ;  a  steam  generating  plant  at  Ontario  ,  Calif.  ,  that  Zurn  will  own  and  operate  ,  and  two  waste-water  control  projects  in  Orange  County  ,  Calif  . 
 AVX  Corp.  and  Unitrode  Corp.  said  they  completed  the  previously  reported  sale  of  Unitrode  's  San  Diego-based  Passive  Components  division  to  AVX  .  AVX  ,  a  New  York-based  maker  of  passive  electronic  products  ,  paid  $  11  million  in  cash  to  Unitrode  ,  a  Lexington-based  maker  of  semiconductor  products  .  Passive  Components  makes  capacitors  and  filters  used  to  protect  electronics  . 
 Consolidated  Papers  Inc.  said  it  plans  to  spend  $  495  million  on  new  paper-manufacturing  equipment  and  facilities  . 
 The  producer  of  paper  used  in  magazines  and  by  commercial  printers  said  spending  on  the  expansion  is  planned  to  begin  in  the  first  quarter  of  1990  .  The  expansion  is  subject  to  approval  by  federal  and  Wisconsin  environmental  regulators  . 
 THE  STOCK  of  Applied  Power  Inc.  ,  which  split  2-for-1  in  May  ,  has  risen  since  August  1988  .  In  yesterday  's  edition  ,  it  was  incorrectly  stated  that  the  company  's  share  price  has  softened  since  August  1988  . 
 (  See  :  ``  Who  's  News  :  With  One  Turnaround  Under  His  Belt  ,  Sim  Aims  for  Another  at  Barry  Wright  ''  --  WSJ  Oct.  17  ,  1989  ) 

 The  stock  market  's  dizzying  gyrations  during  the  past  few  days  have  made  a  lot  of  individual  investors  wish  they  could  buy  some  sort  of  insurance  . 
 After  all  ,  they  wo  n't  soon  forget  the  stock  bargains  that  became  available  after  the  October  1987  crash  .  But  while  they  want  to  be  on  the  alert  for  similar  buying  opportunities  now  ,  they  're  afraid  of  being  hammered  by  another  terrifying  plunge  . 
 The  solution  ,  at  least  for  some  investors  ,  may  be  a  hedging  technique  that  's  well  known  to  players  in  the  stock-options  market  .  Called  a  ``  married  put  ,  ''  the  technique  is  carried  out  by  purchasing  a  stock  and  simultaneously  buying  a  put  option  on  that  stock  . 
 It  's  like  ``  fire  insurance  ,  ''  says  Harrison  Roth  ,  the  senior  options  strategist  at  Cowen  &  Co  .  Because  a  put  option  gives  its  owner  the  right  ,  but  not  the  obligation  ,  to  sell  a  fixed  number  of  shares  of  the  stock  at  a  stated  price  on  or  before  the  option  's  expiration  date  ,  the  investor  is  protected  against  a  sudden  drop  in  the  stock  's  price  . 
 But  most  investment  advisers  do  n't  recommend  using  married  puts  all  the  time  .  That  's  because  the  cost  of  buying  put  options  eats  into  an  investor  's  profit  when  stock  prices  rise  . 
 ``  This  is  the  type  of  fire  insurance  you  only  buy  when  the  nearby  woods  are  on  fire  ,  ''  says  Mr.  Roth  .  ``  You  always  want  your  house  insured  ,  but  you  do  n't  always  feel  the  need  for  your  investments  to  be  insured  .  '' 
 In  addition  to  hedging  new  stock  purchases  ,  the  married-put  technique  can  be  used  to  protect  stocks  that  an  investor  already  owns  .  In  either  case  ,  the  investor  faces  three  possible  outcomes  : 
 --  If  the  stock  goes  up  in  price  between  now  and  the  put  's  expiration  date  ,  the  put  will  probably  expire  worthless  .  The  investor  will  be  out  the  cost  of  the  put  ,  which  is  called  the  ``  premium  ,  ''  and  this  loss  will  reduce  the  stock-market  profit  . 
 --  If  the  stock  stays  at  the  same  price  between  now  and  the  put  's  expiration  date  ,  the  investor  's  loss  will  be  limited  to  the  cost  of  the  put  ,  less  any  amount  realized  from  a  closing  sale  of  the  put  .  The  worst-case  scenario  would  be  if  the  put  expires  worthless  . 
 --  If  the  price  of  the  stock  declines  ,  the  put  will  increase  in  value  .  Once  the  stock  price  is  less  than  the  exercise  price  ,  or  ``  strike  price  ,  ''  of  the  put  ,  the  gain  will  match  the  loss  on  the  stock  dollar  for  dollar  .  The  put  establishes  a  minimum  selling  price  for  the  stock  during  its  life  . 
 When  a  stock  falls  below  the  put  's  strike  price  ,  the  investor  simply  sells  the  stock  at  a  loss  and  simultaneously  sells  the  put  at  a  profit  .  Or  ,  the  investor  can  exercise  the  put  ,  by  tendering  the  stock  to  his  or  her  broker  in  return  for  payment  from  another  investor  who  has  sold  a  put  on  the  same  stock  .  Brokers  handle  such  transactions  through  the  Options  Clearing  Corp.  ,  which  guarantees  all  option  trades  . 
 The  accompanying  table  shows  how  this  strategy  would  work  for  three  stocks  .  Though  not  reflected  in  the  table  ,  an  investor  should  know  that  the  cost  of  the  option  insurance  can  be  partially  offset  by  any  dividends  that  the  stock  pays  . 
 For  example  ,  Tenneco  Inc.  pays  a  quarterly  dividend  of  76  cents  ,  which  would  be  received  before  the  February  option  expires  and  ,  thus  ,  reduce  the  cost  of  using  the  technique  by  that  amount  .  In  this  case  ,  the  investor  's  risk  would  n't  exceed  3.6  %  of  the  total  investment  .  To  simplify  the  calculations  ,  commissions  on  the  option  and  underlying  stock  are  n't  included  in  the  table  . 
 There  are  more  than  650  stocks  on  which  options  may  be  bought  and  sold  ,  including  some  over-the-counter  stocks  .  But  some  investors  might  prefer  a  simpler  strategy  then  hedging  their  individual  holdings  . 
 They  can  do  this  by  purchasing  ``  index  puts  ,  ''  which  are  simply  put  options  on  indexes  that  match  broad  baskets  of  stocks  .  For  instance  ,  the  most  popular  index  option  is  the  S&P  100  option  ,  commonly  called  the  OEX  .  It  is  based  on  the  stocks  that  make  up  Standard  &  Poor  's  100-stock  index  .  Unlike  options  on  individual  issues  ,  index  options  are  settled  only  in  cash  ,  and  no  stock  is  ever  tendered  . 
 But  while  index  options  are  convenient  ,  they  have  several  disadvantages  .  For  one  thing  ,  an  investor  's  portfolio  might  not  closely  match  the  S&P  100  .  As  a  result  ,  the  OEX  insurance  may  or  may  not  fully  protect  an  investor  's  holdings  in  the  event  of  a  market  decline  . 
 In  addition  ,  OEX  options  were  suspended  from  trading  last  Friday  afternoon  ,  after  the  stock-market  sell-off  got  under  way  and  trading  in  the  S&P-500  futures  contract  was  halted  .  So  an  investor  who  wanted  to  realize  a  profit  on  OEX  puts  after  the  trading  suspension  would  have  been  out  of  luck  .  On  the  other  hand  ,  only  a  handful  of  individual  issues  were  suspended  from  trading  on  Friday  .  Normally  ,  once  the  underlying  investment  is  suspended  from  trading  ,  the  options  on  those  investments  also  do  n't  trade  . 
 Ultimately  ,  whether  the  insurance  provided  by  purchasing  puts  is  worthwhile  depends  on  the  cost  of  the  options  .  That  cost  rises  in  times  of  high  market  volatility  .  But  it  still  might  be  cheaper  than  taking  a  major  hit  . 
 The  protection  from  using  married  puts  is  clearly  superior  to  that  afforded  by  another  options  strategy  some  investors  consider  using  during  troubled  times  :  selling  call  options  on  stocks  the  investor  owns  .  A  call  option  is  similar  to  a  put  ,  except  that  it  gives  its  owner  the  right  to  buy  shares  at  a  stated  price  until  expiration  . 
 Selling  a  call  option  gives  an  investor  a  small  buffer  against  a  stock-market  decline  .  That  's  because  it  reduces  the  cost  of  the  stock  by  the  amount  of  premium  received  from  the  sale  of  the  call  .  But  if  the  price  of  the  stock  rises  above  the  strike  price  of  the  option  ,  the  stock  is  almost  certain  to  be  called  away  .  And  in  that  case  ,  the  investor  misses  out  on  any  major  upside  gain  .  These  calculations  exclude  the  effect  of  commissions  paid  and  dividends  received  from  the  stock  .  All  prices  are  as  of  Monday  's  close  . 
 Hopes  for  quick  enactment  of  pending  deficit-reduction  legislation  faded  as  efforts  to  streamline  the  House  version  in  advance  of  a  House-Senate  conference  broke  down  . 
 House  leaders  had  hoped  to  follow  the  Senate  's  lead  by  getting  an  agreement  from  House  committee  chairmen  under  which  they  would  drop  items  that  would  n't  reduce  the  fiscal  1990  budget  deficit  from  the  House-passed  bill  before  the  negotiations  with  the  Senate  began  . 
 But  the  effort  became  snagged  on  the  question  of  what  would  become  of  other  issues  ,  ranging  from  cutting  the  capital-gains  tax  to  child  care  to  repeal  of  catastrophic-illness  insurance  .  ``  Many  members  feel  there  are  important  features  of  the  House  bill  that  should  be  enacted  ,  ''  Speaker  Thomas  Foley  (  D.  ,  Wash  .  )  said  .  ``  If  there  is  any  support  for  reducing  the  bill  ,  it  is  conditioned  on  their  desire  to  see  them  passed  in  another  form  .  '' 
 Now  those  items  will  be  discussed  in  a  House-Senate  conference  ,  which  could  begin  as  soon  as  today  ,  with  the  expectation  that  they  could  either  be  resolved  there  or  placed  into  other  legislation  .  ``  You  've  got  to  give  these  chairmen  the  opportunity  to  see  if  they  can  work  things  out  ,  ''  said  House  Budget  Committee  Chairman  Leon  Panetta  (  D.  ,  Calif  .  )  .  ``  This  is  a  democratic  process  --  you  ca  n't  slam-dunk  anything  around  here  .  '' 
 White  House  Budget  Director  Richard  Darman  has  said  he  would  continue  to  press  to  keep  the  capital-gains  provision  in  the  final  version  of  the  bill  unless  the  House  drops  many  of  its  costly  provisions  . 
 Senate  leaders  had  hoped  to  be  able  to  send  a  compromise  version  of  the  measure  to  President  Bush  by  the  end  of  the  week  ,  but  Speaker  Foley  said  that  was  n't  likely  . 
 Failure  to  pass  the  bill  meant  that  $  16.1  billion  in  across-the-board  spending  cuts  took  effect  Monday  under  the  Gramm-Rudman  budget  law  .  The  bill  must  be  enacted  before  the  cuts  can  be  restored  .

 McCormick  Capital  Inc.  said  its  tender  offer  to  buy  back  as  many  as  1.1  million  ,  or  44  %  ,  of  its  common  shares  at  $  3  apiece  ,  which  expired  Friday  evening  ,  was  oversubscribed  . 
 The  developer  and  manager  of  futures-investment  limited  partnerships  said  preliminary  results  indicate  that  about  1,749,000  shares  had  been  tendered  ,  giving  a  preliminary  proration  factor  of  0.6287  .  The  final  proration  factor  will  be  announced  Monday  . 
 Northgate  Exploration  Ltd.  said  it  is  proposing  to  amalgamate  four  of  its  associated  companies  . 
 Under  a  proposed  two-step  amalgamation  involving  share  swaps  ,  ABM  Gold  Corp.  ,  a  gold  exploration  and  management  company  ,  will  merge  with  Neptune  Resources  Corp.  ,  United  Gold  Corp.  and  Inca  Resources  Inc  . 
 ABM  will  also  increase  its  stake  in  Sonora  Gold  Corp.  to  42  %  from  26  %  .  Northgate  said  it  will  own  about  50  %  of  the  equity  and  81  %  of  the  votes  of  ABM  after  the  amalgamation  . 
 The  amalgamations  are  subject  to  regulatory  approval  and  require  approval  by  shareholders  of  ABM  ,  Inca  ,  United  and  Neptune  at  special  meetings  on  Nov.  10  . 
 Steven  C.  Walker  ,  senior  vice  president  of  this  bank  holding  company  ,  was  named  president  ,  chief  executive  officer  and  a  director  of  both  Commercial  National  and  Commercial  National  Bank  .  He  succeeds  James  E.  Burt  III  ,  who  resigned  from  all  three  posts  to  pursue  other  interests  . 
 Cincinnati  Microwave  Inc.  said  it  introduced  two  radar  detectors  . 
 One  unit  ,  called  the  Escort  ,  uses  a  new  digital  signal-processing  technology  to  detect  radar  signals  much  sooner  than  was  previously  possible  ,  the  company  said  .  The  other  ,  called  the  Solo  ,  is  battery  operated  and  is  the  first  high-performance  radar  detector  that  does  n't  need  a  power  cord  ,  the  company  said  . 
 A  surprising  surge  in  the  U.S.  trade  deficit  raised  fears  that  the  nation  's  export  drive  has  stalled  ,  and  caused  new  turmoil  in  financial  markets  . 
 The  merchandise  trade  deficit  widened  in  August  to  $  10.77  billion  ,  the  Commerce  Department  reported  ,  a  sharp  deterioration  from  July  's  $  8.24  billion  and  the  largest  deficit  of  any  month  this  year  .  Exports  fell  for  the  second  month  in  a  row  ,  while  imports  rose  to  a  record  . 
 ``  This  is  one  of  the  worst  trade  releases  we  've  had  since  the  dollar  troughed  out  in  1987  ,  ''  said  Geoffrey  Dennis  ,  chief  international  economist  at  James  Capel  Inc  .  Like  most  analysts  ,  Mr.  Dennis  was  hesitant  to  read  too  much  into  one  month  's  numbers  ;  but  he  said  ,  ``  It  indicates  perhaps  that  the  balance  in  the  U.S.  economy  is  not  as  good  as  we  've  been  led  to  believe  .  '' 
 The  number  had  a  troubling  effect  on  Wall  Street  ,  suggesting  that  more  fundamental  economic  problems  may  underlie  last  Friday  's  stock  market  slide  .  The  Dow  Jones  Industrial  Average  tumbled  more  than  60  points  after  the  report  's  release  ,  before  recovering  to  close  18.65  points  lower  at  2638.73  . 
 ``  This  bad  trade  number  raises  some  deeper  issues  about  the  market  decline  ,  ''  said  Norman  Robertson  ,  chief  economist  for  Mellon  Bank  .  ``  It  raises  questions  about  more  deep-seated  problems  ,  the  budget  deficit  and  the  trade  deficit  and  the  seeming  lack  of  ability  to  come  to  grips  with  them  .  '' 
 The  trade  report  drew  yet  another  unsettling  parallel  to  October  1987  .  On  Oct.  14  of  that  year  ,  the  announcement  of  an  unusually  large  August  trade  deficit  helped  trigger  a  steep  market  decline  .  The  slide  continued  until  the  record  508-point  market  drop  on  Oct.  19  .  In  1987  ,  however  ,  the  news  was  the  latest  in  a  string  of  disappointments  on  trade  ,  while  the  current  report  comes  after  a  period  of  improvement  . 
 The  bleak  trade  report  was  played  down  by  the  Bush  administration  .  Commerce  Secretary  Robert  Mosbacher  called  the  worsening  trade  figures  ``  disappointing  after  two  very  good  months  .  ''  And  White  House  spokesman  Marlin  Fitzwater  said  the  deficit  was  ``  an  unwelcome  increase  ,  ''  adding  that  ``  we  're  hopeful  that  it  simply  is  a  one-month  situation  and  will  turn  around  .  '' 
 But  the  figures  reinforced  the  view  of  many  private  analysts  that  the  improvement  in  the  U.S.  trade  deficit  has  run  out  of  steam  . 
 ``  The  figures  today  add  further  evidence  to  support  the  view  that  the  improvement  in  the  U.S.  trade  deficit  has  essentially  stalled  out  at  a  level  of  about  a  $  110  billion  annual  rate  ,  ''  said  Jeffrey  Scott  ,  a  research  fellow  at  the  Institute  for  International  Economics  here  .  ``  That  's  still  an  improvement  over  last  year  ,  but  it  leads  one  to  conclude  that  basically  we  've  gotten  all  the  mileage  we  can  out  of  past  dollar  depreciation  and  past  marginal  cuts  in  the  federal  budget  deficit  .  '' 
 Exports  declined  for  the  second  consecutive  month  in  August  ,  slipping  0.2  %  to  $  30.41  billion  ,  the  Commerce  Department  reported  .  Imports  ,  on  the  other  hand  ,  leaped  6.4  %  to  a  record  $  41.18  billion  . 
 Not  only  was  August  's  deficit  far  worse  than  July  's  ,  but  the  government  revised  the  July  figure  substantially  from  the  $  7.58  billion  deficit  it  had  initially  reported  last  month  . 
 Many  economists  contend  that  deep  cuts  in  the  U.S.  budget  deficit  are  needed  before  further  trade  improvement  can  occur  .  That  's  because  the  budget  deficit  feeds  an  enormous  appetite  in  this  country  for  both  foreign  goods  and  foreign  capital  ,  overwhelming  the  nation  's  capacity  to  export  .  ``  People  are  sick  and  tired  of  hearing  about  these  deficits  ,  but  the  imbalances  are  still  there  and  they  are  still  a  problem  ,  ''  said  Mr.  Robertson  . 
 In  addition  ,  the  rise  in  the  value  of  the  dollar  against  foreign  currencies  over  the  past  several  months  has  increased  the  price  of  U.S.  products  in  overseas  markets  and  hurt  the  country  's  competitiveness  .  Since  March  ,  exports  have  been  virtually  flat  .  At  the  same  time  ,  William  T.  Archey  ,  international  vice  president  at  the  U.S.  Chamber  of  Commerce  ,  notes  :  ``  Clearly  the  stronger  dollar  has  made  imports  more  attractive  ''  by  causing  their  prices  to  decline  . 
 Most  economists  expect  the  slowing  U.S.  economy  to  curb  demand  for  imports  .  But  they  foresee  little  substantial  progress  in  exports  unless  the  dollar  and  the  federal  budget  deficit  come  down  . 
 ``  The  best  result  we  could  get  from  these  numbers  would  be  to  see  the  administration  and  Congress  get  serious  about  putting  the  U.S.  on  an  internationally  competitive  economic  footing  ,  ''  said  Howard  Lewis  ,  vice  president  of  international  economic  affairs  at  the  National  Association  of  Manufacturers  .  ``  That  must  start  with  cutting  the  federal  budget  deficit  .  '' 
 August  's  decline  in  exports  reflected  decreases  in  sales  of  industrial  supplies  ,  capital  goods  and  food  abroad  and  increases  in  sales  of  motor  vehicles  ,  parts  and  engines  .  The  jump  in  imports  stemmed  from  across-the-board  increases  in  purchases  of  foreign  goods  . 
 The  numbers  were  adjusted  for  usual  seasonal  fluctuations  .

 Steve  Jobs  took  a  step  back  from  the  frontier  of  personal-computer  technology  in  an  effort  to  spur  sales  of  Next  Inc.  's  new  machine  . 
 Mr.  Jobs  moved  to  remedy  a  couple  of  his  computer  's  drawbacks  yesterday  by  lowering  the  entry-level  price  for  a  Next  machine  by  $  1,500  ,  or  23  %  ,  if  the  buyer  chooses  a  hard-disk  drive  as  an  alternative  to  Next  's  optical-storage  device  .  The  hard  drive  ,  which  is  the  storage  device  of  choice  for  virtually  every  desktop  computer  user  ,  also  now  will  supplement  Next  's  futuristic  optical  device  if  buyers  pay  full  price  . 
 Mr.  Jobs  ,  co-founder  of  Apple  Computer  Inc.  ,  founded  Next  four  years  ago  in  the  hopes  of  fomenting  a  revolution  in  the  way  desktop  computers  are  designed  and  used  .  His  Next  computer  ,  introduced  about  a  year  ago  and  aimed  primarily  at  university  computer  users  ,  sports  snazzy  graphics  ,  digital  sound  ,  built-in  networking  and  a  sleek  black  design  .  But  the  computer  was  proving  a  hard  sell  because  of  its  high  price  ,  a  lack  of  software  and  an  optical  data-storage  device  that  was  too  slow  . 
 The  machine  began  shipping  at  the  end  of  last  year  .  The  closely  held  company  has  n't  disclosed  sales  .  However  ,  most  universities  that  have  bought  the  machines  say  they  are  buying  small  numbers  for  evaluation  purposes  . 
 Universities  can  now  buy  a  Next  computer  without  an  optical  storage  device  for  $  4,995  .  A  computer  with  the  optical  device  will  still  cost  $  6,495  ,  but  from  now  on  Next  will  outfit  every  computer  with  a  hard  drive  and  supply  one  at  no  cost  to  those  who  have  already  bought  Next  machines  . 
 Commercial  customers  can  purchase  the  same  system  through  Businessland  Inc.  ,  a  computer  retailer  based  in  San  Jose  ,  Calif.  ,  for  roughly  $  3,000  more  . 
 Mr.  Jobs  said  the  changes  were  prompted  by  requests  from  customers  who  are  frustrated  with  the  performance  of  the  optical  device  ,  which  is  n't  offered  as  standard  equipment  by  any  rivals  .  Another  factor  was  that  customers  were  asking  ,  ``  Why  do  n't  you  give  us  a  cheaper  system  ?  ''  Mr.  Jobs  said  at  a  conference  on  university  computing  here  .  Optical-storage  devices  can  handle  very  large  amounts  of  data  and  make  it  far  easier  to  edit  film  clips  or  audio  recordings  with  a  computer  .  But  the  technology  ,  while  reliable  ,  is  far  slower  than  the  widely  used  hard  drives  . 
 To  get  around  the  delays  caused  by  the  optical  device  ,  Businessland  ,  which  is  Next  's  exclusive  dealer  to  corporations  ,  has  for  months  been  advising  customers  to  purchase  hard  drives  with  the  machines  . 
 Next  's  decision  to  rely  on  the  more-established  hard  drive  in  every  Next  computer  does  n't  signal  a  retreat  from  optical  storage  ,  said  Mr.  Jobs  ,  who  for  years  has  said  this  technology  will  play  a  crucial  role  in  the  next  decade  .  ``  We  're  extremely  committed  to  optical  storage  technology  ''  he  said  .  ``  We  think  everything  will  go  this  way  in  a  few  years  .  ''  He  said  that  the  next  generation  of  optical  drives  will  be  as  fast  as  hard  drives  ,  but  he  depends  on  outside  suppliers  for  the  devices  . 
 But  university  computer  specialists  ,  who  welcomed  the  move  ,  called  it  a  necessary  retreat  from  the  cutting  edge  of  technology  and  one  that  's  likely  to  increase  Next  's  sales  on  campuses  . 
 ``  From  the  standpoint  of  being  on  the  forefront  of  technology  ,  this  is  a  step  backward  ,  ''  said  Jerry  W.  Sprecher  ,  a  senior  computing  manager  for  the  California  state  university  system  .  ``  But  it  will  definitely  boost  Next  's  sales  .  '' 
 Universities  ,  however  ,  say  Next  's  prices  must  go  even  lower  before  large  numbers  of  students  purchase  the  machine  .  ``  We  'd  still  like  to  see  a  student  model  ,  ''  priced  at  about  $  3,500  ,  said  Ronald  Johnson  ,  director  of  academic  computing  at  Minnesota  's  Gustavus  Adolphus  College  ,  which  has  bought  eight  Next  machines  . 
 Broad  acceptance  of  Next  's  computer  also  is  hindered  by  difficulty  in  distributing  software  for  it  .  Most  software  is  distributed  on  cheap  floppy  disks  ,  but  the  Next  computer  does  n't  come  with  a  device  that  reads  them  . 
 Next  's  computer  also  needs  more  software  applications  ,  but  Mr.  Jobs  said  he  expects  more  soon  .  He  said  he  expects  Lotus  Development  Corp.  to  introduce  a  Next  version  of  its  popular  1-2-3  spreadsheet  program  in  1990  . 
 Educators  added  that  Next  needs  to  soon  offer  a  color  version  of  its  computer  .  Every  major  maker  offers  computers  with  color  displays  .  Next  wo  n't  comment  on  when  it  will  do  the  same  ,  but  is  believed  to  have  a  color  model  under  development  . 
 Donald  J.  Amaral  ,  37  years  old  ,  was  named  president  and  chief  operating  officer  of  this  owner  and  operator  of  hospitals  ,  nursing  centers  and  retirement  hotels  .  He  succeeds  as  president  ,  Don  Freeberg  ,  who  remains  chairman  and  chief  executive  officer  .  The  position  of  chief  operating  officer  is  new  . 
 Ashton-Tate  Corp.  reported  a  net  loss  of  $  19.4  million  ,  or  74  cents  a  share  ,  for  the  third  quarter  ,  which  was  burdened  by  severance  costs  and  the  expense  of  upgrading  its  database  software  inventories  . 
 The  software  company  said  revenue  slid  28  %  to  $  53.9  million  .  This  contrasts  with  the  year-ago  quarter  ,  when  the  company  had  net  income  of  $  11.7  million  ,  or  45  cents  a  share  ,  on  revenue  of  $  75.7  million  . 
 For  the  nine  months  ,  Ashton-Tate  had  a  loss  of  $  27.6  million  ,  or  $  1.05  a  share  .  In  the  year-ago  period  ,  the  company  had  profit  of  $  34.3  million  ,  or  $  1.32  a  share  .  Revenue  in  the  period  slid  almost  8  %  to  $  203.2  million  from  about  $  220  million  last  year  . 
 Edward  M.  Esber  ,  chairman  ,  president  and  chief  executive  officer  ,  attributed  the  decline  to  reduced  domestic  revenue  because  of  $  4.9  million  spent  to  upgrade  existing  software  inventories  to  the  new  database  IV  Version  1.1  ,  and  $  1.8  million  spent  on  the  recent  reduction  in  work  force  .  He  said  the  company  was  ``  encouraged  by  feedback  ''  it  received  from  selected  customers  now  testing  Version  1.1  . 
 The  red  ink  came  as  no  surprise  to  Wall  Street  ,  but  analysts  said  they  saw  ominous  hints  of  a  further  delay  in  volume  shipments  of  Version  1.1  ,  a  harbinger  of  continued  losses  in  the  fourth  quarter  . 
 ``  The  loss  is  in  line  with  our  expectations  ,  ''  said  John  C.  Maxwell  III  ,  an  analyst  with  Dillon  ,  Read  &  Co.  in  New  York  .  He  added  gross  margins  and  operating  profit  ``  eroded  quite  dramatically  ''  from  the  prior  quarter  ,  along  with  sales  of  existing  software  product  lines  like  Multimate  and  Framework  . 
 ``  The  success  of  a  new  product  in  the  database  line  is  needed  .  And  while  the  company  has  n't  made  a  definite  statement  ,  it  now  looks  like  that  's  not  going  to  be  anytime  soon  ,  ''  Mr.  Maxwell  said  .  The  company  said  in  a  statement  that  it  expects  to  ship  new  products  ``  during  the  next  two  quarters  .  '' 
 ``  It  now  looks  like  database  IV  Version  1.1  is  n't  going  to  be  {  widely  }  available  until  the  first  quarter  of  1990  ,  ''  said  David  Bayer  ,  an  analyst  with  Montgomery  Securities  in  San  Francisco  .  ``  This  is  the  second  delay  now  in  getting  the  product  out  the  door  .  It  does  prolong  the  pain  somewhat  .  '' 
 Mr.  Maxwell  said  unless  the  company  can  start  shipments  of  the  new  product  sometime  this  quarter  ,  the  fourth-quarter  loss  is  likely  to  be  ``  comparable  to  the  third  quarter  's  .  ''  If  the  company  can  start  to  ship  during  this  quarter  ,  it  could  stem  some  ,  if  not  all  of  the  red  ink  ,  he  said  . 
 In  national  over-the-counter  trading  ,  Ashton-Tate  closed  yesterday  at  $  10  a  share  ,  up  62.5  cents  .

In  the  chemicals  segment  ,  pretax  profit  rose  7  %  to  $  69.2  million  from  $  64.9  million  .

 Revenue  was  $  1.79  billion  ,  up  18  %  from  $  1.52  billion  a  year  earlier  . 
 In  New  York  Stock  Exchange  composite  trading  ,  Ethyl  closed  at  $  25.875  a  share  ,  up  12.5  cents  . 
 Tribune  Co.  ,  helped  by  a  hefty  boost  in  performance  at  its  broadcasting  and  entertainment  operations  ,  said  net  income  jumped  21  %  in  its  third  quarter  ended  Sept.  24  on  a  3  %  increase  in  revenue  . 
 The  broadcasting  and  newspaper  concern  ,  based  in  Chicago  ,  said  net  was  $  62.7  million  ,  or  77  cents  a  primary  share  ,  up  from  $  51.6  million  ,  or  69  cents  a  share  .

Revenue  rose  4  %  to  $  1.79  billion  . 
 In  New  York  Stock  Exchange  composite  trading  Friday  ,  Tribune  closed  at  $  49.375  ,  down  $  4.75  . 
 Enserch  Corp.  said  about  12  million  ,  or  93  %  ,  of  the  publicly  traded  units  of  its  limited  partnership  ,  Enserch  Exploration  Partners  Ltd.  ,  were  tendered  in  response  to  an  offer  that  expired  Monday  . 
 Enserch  said  the  tendered  units  will  raise  its  ownership  of  the  partnership  to  more  than  99  %  from  87  %  .  About  900,000  units  will  continue  to  be  publicly  traded  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  ,  Enserch  said  .  Enserch  had  offered  one-half  a  share  of  its  common  and  $  1  in  cash  for  each  unit  . 
 The  public  sector  borrowing  requirement  ,  the  most  widely  used  measure  of  Britain  's  government  deficit  or  surplus  ,  showed  a  deficit  of  #  200  million  in  September  ,  compared  with  a  deficit  of  #  765  million  in  August  and  a  deficit  of  #  1.08  billion  in  September  1988  ,  the  Treasury  said  . 
 In  the  six  months  since  the  current  fiscal  year  began  April  1  ,  the  surplus  totaled  #  500  million  ,  compared  with  a  surplus  of  #  3.6  billion  in  the  year-earlier  period  . 
 The  government  is  projecting  a  #  14  billion  surplus  for  the  fiscal  year  . 
 The  reported  figures  for  the  public  sector  borrowing  requirement  include  receipts  from  the  sale  of  state-owned  industries  .  Excluding  those  receipts  ,  the  government  deficit  would  have  totaled  about  #  2.5  billion  in  the  first  six  months  ,  compared  with  #  1.3  billion  a  year  earlier  ,  the  Treasury  said  . 
 French  crude-steel  production  in  September  was  1,616,000  metric  tons  ,  unchanged  from  a  year  earlier  ,  according  to  the  National  Steel  Manufacturers  '  Association  . 
 The  association  said  the  September  total  brought  French  output  for  the  first  nine  months  this  year  to  14,789,000  tons  ,  up  4.5  %  from  a  year  earlier  . 
 Prospect  Group  Inc.  ,  whose  recent  hostile  tender  offer  for  Recognition  Equipment  Inc.  failed  for  lack  of  financing  ,  apparently  has  gained  a  measure  of  control  over  the  troubled  company  anyway  . 
 As  part  of  what  a  Recognition  spokeswoman  termed  an  ``  amiable  agreement  ,  ''  Prospect  Group  will  wind  up  with  control  of  top  management  posts  and  an  increased  stake  in  the  maker  of  data  management  equipment  . 
 In  a  management  restructuring  ,  Thomas  L.  Ringer  resigned  as  chairman  ,  chief  executive  and  a  director  ,  while  Israel  Sheinberg  resigned  as  a  director  .  Mr.  Sheinberg  remains  as  executive  vice  president  .  Thomas  M.  Hurley  and  Robert  A.  Vanourek  ,  who  had  been  designated  to  take  over  Recognition  's  top  spots  had  Prospect  's  tender  offer  succeeded  ,  were  named  co-chief  executives  and  directors  .  Mr.  Hurley  was  formerly  a  vice  president  and  general  manager  of  an  Avery  International  division  ;  Mr.  Vanourek  was  a  former  group  vice  president  of  Pitney  Bowes  Inc  . 
 In  addition  ,  the  agreement  calls  for  Gilbert  H.  Lamphere  ,  chairman  of  Prospect  Group  's  executive  committee  ,  to  be  named  chairman  of  a  restructured  board  that  will  include  four  new  independent  directors  .  Also  named  to  the  revised  board  was  Thomas  A.  Loose  ,  Recognition  's  senior  vice  president  and  general  counsel  . 
 Prospect  ,  a  New  York-based  leveraged  buy-out  firm  ,  also  agreed  to  invest  $  15  million  in  Recognition  ,  which  in  turn  agreed  to  repurchase  as  much  as  $  20  million  of  its  stock  .  That  would  increase  Prospect  's  ownership  of  the  company  's  fully-diluted  shares  outstanding  to  20  %  from  14.1  %  .  Under  the  agreement  ,  Prospect  is  permitted  to  increase  its  stake  in  Recognition  to  30  %  .  Beyond  that  ,  Prospect  said  it  would  n't  offer  to  acquire  additional  shares  for  less  than  $  11.25  a  share  during  the  next  year  or  less  than  $  14.06  a  share  during  the  subsequent  two  years  . 
 Recognition  also  said  it  obtained  a  commitment  from  Chemical  Bank  and  Bank  of  Boston  to  convert  an  estimated  $  18  million  in  bank  debt  to  a  new  ,  24-month  secured  term  loan  to  be  repaid  through  the  sale  of  certain  assets  . 
 In  August  ,  Recognition  said  it  was  in  violation  of  certain  terms  of  its  debt  agreements  with  bank  lenders  because  of  a  $  3.9  million  loss  for  the  third  quarter  ended  July  31  .  The  company  attributed  the  loss  to  declining  revenue  and  litigation  costs  relating  to  criminal  charges  against  the  company  and  two  former  executives  ,  William  G.  Moore  Jr.  and  Robert  W.  Reedy  .  The  former  executives  were  indicted  last  October  on  charges  of  fraud  ,  theft  and  conspiracy  related  to  efforts  by  the  company  to  win  $  400  million  in  Postal  Service  contracts  . 
 Recognition  Equipment  said  it  expected  to  put  the  agreement  with  Prospect  to  a  vote  of  its  stockholders  at  a  special  meeting  in  January  . 
 In  New  York  Stock  Exchange  composite  trading  ,  Recognition  rose  87.5  cents  to  $  6.625  .  Prospect  slipped  25  cents  to  $  10.50  in  national  over-the-counter  trading  . 
 General  Motors  Corp.  's  Chevrolet  division  ,  reacting  to  slow  sales  ,  said  it  will  offer  $  800  rebates  on  its  1990  Beretta  ,  the  two-door  version  of  its  core  compact-car  line  . 
 Sluggish  sales  of  the  Beretta  ,  and  its  four-door  sister  car  ,  the  Corsica  ,  prompted  GM  to  idle  the  two  plants  that  build  the  automobiles  for  a  total  of  three  weeks  this  month  .  The  Corsica  and  Beretta  make  up  the  highest-volume  car  line  at  Chevrolet  ,  but  sales  of  the  vehicles  are  off  9.6  %  for  the  year  ,  and  fell  a  steep  34  %  during  early  October  . 
 Chevrolet  already  is  offering  an  $  800  rebate  on  the  1990-model  Corsica  .  The  latest  rebate  is  good  for  all  Beretta  models  .  Chevrolet  buyers  can  take  the  rebate  ,  or  get  discount  financing  at  rates  ranging  from  6.9  %  on  24-month  loans  to  10.9  %  on  60-month  loans  . 
 StatesWest  Airlines  said  it  submitted  an  offer  to  the  directors  of  Mesa  Airlines  to  acquire  the  Farmington  ,  N.M.  ,  carrier  . 
 Except  to  characterize  its  offer  as  ``  fair  and  generous  and  in  the  best  interests  of  Mesa  shareholders  ,  ''  StatesWest  declined  to  discuss  details  of  its  proposal  .  It  also  asked  Mesa  to  keep  the  proposal  confidential  .  A  Mesa  official  confirmed  receipt  of  the  offer  and  said  directors  would  meet  to  consider  it  . 
 Last  week  ,  Mesa  rejected  a  proposal  by  StatesWest  to  acquire  it  or  merge  . 
 StatesWest  has  a  7.25  %  stake  in  Mesa  ,  which  operates  20  twin-engine  and  two  single-engine  turboprops  among  42  cities  in  New  Mexico  ,  Arizona  ,  Wyoming  ,  Colorado  and  Texas  . 
 StatesWest  operates  four  twin-engine  turboprop  aircraft  ,  connecting  10  cities  in  California  ,  Arizona  and  Nevada  .  The  carrier  has  n't  yet  turned  a  profit  . 
 The  former  president  of  FirstSouth  F.A.  ,  a  defunct  Arkansas  thrift  ,  pleaded  guilty  to  conspiring  to  inflate  the  institution  's  earnings  by  concealing  worthless  loan  guarantees  . 
 Roderick  D.  Reed  III  ,  who  was  also  chief  operating  officer  of  FirstSouth  ,  could  receive  a  maximum  sentence  of  five  years  in  federal  prison  and  a  $  250,000  fine  .  A  sentencing  date  has  n't  been  set  . 
 Mr.  Reed  admitted  he  conspired  to  conceal  an  agreement  not  to  enforce  loan  guarantees  executed  by  Dallas  real-estate  developers  A.  Starke  Taylor  III  and  George  S.  Watson  ,  both  of  whom  were  FirstSouth  stockholders  .  Neither  Mr.  Taylor  nor  Mr.  Watson  have  been  charged  with  criminal  wrongdoing  . 
 By  concealing  the  non-enforcement  agreement  ,  certain  transactions  with  Messrs.  Taylor  and  Watson  were  entered  on  FirstSouth  's  books  as  loans  ,  allowing  the  thrift  to  report  fees  and  interest  as  current  income  ,  according  to  the  U.S.  attorney  's  office  in  Little  Rock  ,  Ark  . 
 The  conspiracy  was  part  of  an  effort  by  Mr.  Reed  to  hide  FirstSouth  's  shaky  financial  condition  from  federal  regulators  ,  according  to  federal  prosecutors  and  regulators  .  The  $  1.68  billion  thrift  was  declared  insolvent  and  closed  in  December  1986  . 
 FirstSouth  's  former  chairman  and  chief  executive  officer  ,  Howard  Weichern  ,  is  also  charged  with  conspiring  to  conceal  the  agreements  with  Messrs.  Watson  and  Taylor  .  Mr.  Weichern  is  scheduled  for  trial  Jan.  3  before  federal  Judge  Stephen  Reasoner  of  Little  Rock  . 
 I  approached  ``  Mastergate  ,  ''  Larry  Gelbart  's  new  comedy  at  the  Criterion  Center  ,  with  considerable  trepidation  .  Nothing  ,  I  assumed  ,  would  be  more  hopelessly  dated  than  a  political  satire  on  the  Iran-Contra  affair  .  I  had  underestimated  ,  however  ,  both  Mr.  Gelbart  's  wit  and  the  persistence  of  scandal  in  Washington  .  Though  the  play  clearly  is  framed  around  the  events  of  Iran-Contra  ,  it  takes  in  the  wide  sweep  of  scandals  over  the  past  30  years  .  In  fact  ,  at  one  point  Merry  Chase  (  Melinda  Mullins  )  ,  a  cool  ,  carefully  coiffed  television  announcer  ,  recites  a  list  of  a  dozen  or  more  scandals  of  recent  years  ,  concluding  with  those  affecting  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  and  the  savings  and  loan  industry  . 
 Onstage  ,  a  congressional  hearing  is  in  progress  ,  complete  with  elegant  crystal  chandelier  overhead  and  a  lifesize  reproduction  of  the  signing  of  the  Constitution  in  the  background  .  The  witness  table  is  center  stage  and  below  it  ,  the  paraphernalia  for  the  ever-present  media  ,  in  this  case  TNN  ,  the  Total  News  Network  .  Not  only  are  there  camera  operators  on  all  sides  ,  but  the  proceedings  are  shown  on  monitors  throughout  the  theater  . 
 The  metaphor  of  theater  is  not  entirely  coincidental  .  Mr.  Gelbart  clearly  feels  that  all  the  participants  in  a  congressional  hearing  --  the  witnesses  ,  the  lawyers  ,  the  interrogators  and  the  news  media  --  are  performers  . 
 As  the  story  of  ``  Mastergate  ''  unfolds  ,  we  learn  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  confiscated  one  of  the  properties  of  a  foreign  financier  who  owes  the  government  millions  in  taxes  .  The  man  ,  it  seems  ,  has  a  Lichtenstein  corporation  ,  licensed  in  Libya  and  sheltered  in  the  Bahamas  .  He  himself  lives  in  a  ``  consecutive  series  of  unnumbered  houses  in  a  town  in  Switzerland  .  ''  The  property  seized  by  the  IRS  is  a  Hollywood  film  studio  ,  Master  Pictures  Incorporated  (  MPI  )  .  Supposedly  the  IRS  will  sell  off  the  assets  of  MPI  ,  but  before  it  can  ,  a  lowly  IRS  agent  is  called  into  the  hospital  room  of  Wylie  Slaughter  ,  the  dying  head  of  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency  . 
 The  lowly  agent  ,  Abel  Lamb  ,  who  as  you  might  guess  ,  is  being  led  to  the  slaughter  ,  is  ordered  to  take  over  the  studio  .  Soon  the  studio  is  producing  a  $  40  million  picture  called  ``  Tet  ,  the  Motion  Picture  ,  ''  to  distinguish  it  from  ``  Tet  ,  the  Offensive  ,  ''  as  well  as  ``  Tet  ,  the  Book  ''  and  ``  Tet  ,  the  Album  .  ''  The  picture  ,  to  be  made  in  the  Central  American  country  of  San  Elvador  ,  is  a  cover  for  sending  $  800  million  of  arms  to  Los  Otros  ,  the  rebel  group  attempting  to  regain  neighboring  Ambigua  ,  which  has  been  taken  over  by  the  leftist  dictator  Dr.  Overtega  ,  a  former  podiatrist  ,  who  leads  a  revolutionary  band  of  foot  soldiers  .  The  man  handling  all  this  for  the  now-deceased  Slaughter  is  Major  Manley  Battle  ,  Mr.  Gelbart  's  stand  in  for  Col.  Oliver  North  . 
 Director  Michael  Engler  has  assembled  a  top-flight  cast  to  carry  out  the  impersonations  of  well-known  political  figures  and  to  play  the  stock  characters  who  invariably  show  up  at  congressional  hearings  .  Daniel  von  Bargen  is  ramrod-stiff  but  totally  assured  as  Major  Battle  ,  mixing  just  the  right  brand  of  self-righteousness  and  patriotism  ;  Jeff  Weiss  is  fire  ,  brimstone  and  teary-eyed  emotionalism  as  the  far-right  senator  who  serves  as  a  friendly  interrogator  of  Major  Battle  ;  Zach  Grenier  is  maddeningly  officious  playing  a  succession  of  lawyers  ;  Joseph  Daly  has  the  perfect  ``  aw  ,  shucks  ''  demeanor  of  George  Bush  in  his  portrayal  of  the  vice  president  ;  and  Ann  McDonough  is  first-rate  as  a  succession  of  witnesses  '  wives  .  With  one  she  is  pregnant  ,  with  Major  Battle  she  is  knitting  an  American  flag  ,  and  as  the  vice  president  's  wife  she  rushes  in  with  white  hair  ,  wearing  a  tailored  suit  and  pearls  ,  imitating  Barbara  Bush  's  gestures  down  to  the  last  detail  . 
 Though  it  's  clear  that  Mr.  Gelbart  's  sympathies  do  not  lie  with  the  far  right  ,  it  's  also  true  that  he  is  evenhanded  in  dispensing  his  satirical  jabs  ,  taking  sharp  aim  at  senators  and  congressmen  of  all  stripes  and  particularly  at  the  media  .  Mr.  Gelbart  also  has  fun  with  language  .  ``  Mastergate  ''  is  subtitled  ``  a  play  on  words  ,  ''  and  Mr.  Gelbart  plays  that  game  as  well  as  anyone  .  He  describes  a  Mastergate  flunky  as  one  who  experienced  a  ``  meteoric  disappearance  ''  and  found  himself  ``  handling  blanket  appeals  at  the  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs  .  '' 
 This  interest  in  words  goes  beyond  puns  and  playfulness  ,  however  .  Mr.  Gelbart  deplores  the  obfuscation  ,  the  circumlocution  and  the  debasement  of  language  he  sees  on  all  sides  .  As  the  hearings  begin  ,  the  self-important  Sen.  Bowman  (  Jerome  Kilty  )  announces  :  ``  Let  me  emphaticize  one  thing  at  the  outset  :  We  are  not  looking  for  hides  to  skin  nor  goats  to  scape  .  ''  Major  Battle  himself  speaks  in  pure  Pentagonese  :  ``  Without  further  monetary-stroke-military  aid  ,  scores  of  Ambiguan  freedom  lovers  ,  who  had  gone  way  out  on  their  life  and  limbs  for  us  ,  were  literally  cut  off  at  the  knees  without  a  paddle  .  ''  At  another  point  he  intones  :  ``  Publicity  is  a  small  price  to  pay  for  secrecy  .  '' 
 The  evening  is  short  --  95  minutes  without  an  intermission  --  but  even  so  ,  as  the  play  progresses  the  thrust  of  Mr.  Gelbart  's  satire  loses  its  sharpness  as  his  targets  pop  up  ever  more  predictably  .  Most  of  the  evening  ,  though  ,  is  filled  with  rare  and  welcome  wit  .  In  ``  Mastergate  ,  ''  Mr.  Gelbart  has  provided  us  not  just  one  but  two  commodities  that  have  all  but  disappeared  from  the  Broadway  theater  :  sharp  political  satire  and  an  even  sharper  appreciation  of  the  value  of  language  . 
 The  Federal  National  Mortgage  Association  set  up  a  three-member  office  of  the  chairman  and  elected  James  A.  Johnson  as  vice  chairman  ,  effective  Jan.  1  . 
 Mr.  Johnson  has  been  a  managing  director  at  Shearson  Lehman  Hutton  since  1985  ,  and  before  that  was  president  of  Public  Strategies  ,  a  Washington  consulting  firm  .  He  is  well-known  in  Democratic  circles  ,  having  been  executive  assistant  to  Vice  President  Walter  Mondale  and  chairman  of  Mr.  Mondale  's  1984  presidential  campaign  . 
 At  Fannie  Mae  ,  he  will  take  responsibility  for  the  corporation  's  financial  and  legal  areas  and  will  work  with  David  Maxwell  ,  chairman  and  chief  executive  officer  ,  and  Roger  Birk  ,  president  and  chief  operating  officer  ,  on  strategic  planning  . 
 Mr.  Johnson  ,  45  years  old  ,  has  been  a  consultant  on  strategy  to  Fannie  Mae  for  the  past  3  1\  years  .  In  an  interview  ,  he  said  Fannie  Mae  faces  a  number  of  challenges  with  the  restructuring  of  the  thrift  industry  and  the  push  to  broaden  its  activities  overseas  .  ``  There  's  no  shortage  of  major  things  to  do  ,  ''  he  said  . 
 Fannie  Mae  also  said  James  A.  Aliber  ,  chairman  of  First  Federal  of  Michigan  and  a  director  since  1985  ,  moved  up  the  date  of  his  retirement  from  the  board  to  accommodate  Mr.  Johnson  's  election  as  a  director  .  The  board  has  13  members  elected  by  holders  and  five  presidential  appointees  . 
 Fannie  Mae  ,  a  federally  chartered  ,  shareholder-owned  corporation  ,  operates  a  secondary  market  for  mortgage  loans  ,  buying  loans  from  lenders  ,  packaging  some  into  securities  for  sale  to  investors  and  keeping  the  rest  in  its  portfolio  . 
 ``  The  New  Crowd  ''  by  Judith  Ramsey  Ehrlich  and  Barry  J.  Rehfeld  (  Little  ,  Brown  ,  444  pages  ,  $  19.95  )  ,  describes  the  displacing  of  the  old  ``  our  crowd  ''  Jewish  Wall  Street  banking  grandees  by  such  new  business  barons  as  Saul  Steinberg  ,  Carl  Icahn  ,  Sanford  Weill  and  Bruce  Wasserstein  .  Its  many  lively  stories  include  the  Gutfreund-Postel  holiday  cheer  imbroglio  .  These  two  New  Crowd  families  lived  in  the  same  apartment  building  ,  with  the  Postel  penthouse  perched  on  top  of  the  Gutfreund  duplex  .  The  penthouse  elevator  started  up  from  the  Gutfreund  landing  ,  and  Susan  Gutfreund  used  to  turn  off  its  light  ,  to  give  the  impression  that  there  was  no  higher  floor  .  Eventually  ,  Mr.  Postel  broke  his  toe  in  the  dark  . 
 Then  the  Gutfreunds  determined  to  put  up  a  22-foot  Christmas  tree  ,  weighing  a  quarter  of  a  ton  ,  to  amaze  their  holiday  guests  .  For  this  ,  a  crane  needed  to  be  mounted  on  the  Postels  '  terrace  .  The  Postels  did  not  give  permission  .  But  the  Gutfreund  workers  went  ahead  anyway  ,  only  to  be  captured  ``  in  flagrante  ''  by  Joan  Postel  ,  who  called  the  police  . 
 Before  the  Gutfreunds  finally  left  this  unfriendly  environment  for  a  prodigious  duplex  on  Fifth  Avenue  and  an  18th-century  mansion  with  a  specially  excavated  $  1  million  garage  in  Paris  ,  the  Postels  had  obtained  an  injunction  to  prevent  any  future  hoisting  of  trees  ,  and  in  a  neighborly  spirit  hit  both  the  Gutfreunds  and  the  building  with  a  $  35  million  lawsuit  .  Nothing  less  ,  it  seemed  ,  could  console  them  for  their  traumas  . 
 Where  had  all  the  money  come  from  ?  The  young  John  Gutfreund  had  been  discovered  by  Billy  Salomon  of  Salomon  Bros.  when  he  was  still  a  bearded  liberal  ,  and  put  to  work  as  a  trader  ,  and  then  as  a  rough-and-tumble  syndicator  .  ``  `  Get  off  your  ...  ,  '  he  would  bellow  ,  ''  say  the  authors  .  Rising  in  the  firm  ,  he  became  powerful  and  bland  ,  though  his  new  wife  ,  Susan  ,  made  him  shine  in  the  gossip  columns  with  her  profligate  spending  habits  and  flamboyant  frocks  .  After  he  had  been  head  of  the  company  for  3  1\  years  ,  he  and  his  partners  sold  it  to  Phibro  ,  a  powerful  commodity  trading  outfit  ,  for  $  550  million  in  Phibro  stock  .  Limited  partner  Billy  Salomon  ,  whose  family  name  had  been  on  the  firm  's  door  for  70  years  and  who  had  hoped  it  would  be  there  forever  ,  was  not  consulted  .  Mr.  Gutfreund  collected  $  32  million  ,  while  Billy  Salomon  got  $  10  million  ,  much  less  than  if  he  had  conducted  the  sale  .  ``  I  felt  betrayed  ,  ''  he  later  said  .  Worse  ,  Salomon  's  timing  had  been  off  .  Its  profits  ,  unlike  Phibro  's  ,  soared  over  the  next  two  years  ,  and  had  it  held  out  ,  Salomon  could  have  gotten  an  even  bigger  bundle  . 
 The  book  also  recounts  the  not  dissimilar  maneuvers  surrounding  the  changing  of  the  guard  at  Lehman  Bros.  and  other  grand  old  firms  .  Often  the  genteel  ,  conservative  ,  long-term-oriented  investment  bankers  were  displaced  by  crude  traders  :  ``  When  angered  ,  he  cursed  so  forcefully  that  his  face  reddened  and  his  pale-blue  eyes  narrowed  into  tiny  slits  ,  ''  the  authors  say  of  Lehman  's  Lewis  Glucksman  . 
 The  earlier  generation  of  ``  our  crowd  ''  bankers  --  Belmonts  ,  Warburgs  ,  Lehmans  ,  Baches  and  Schiffs  --  had  stressed  above  all  probity  ,  tradition  ,  continuity  and  reputation  .  They  were  old-fashioned  elegant  gentlemen  ,  who  happened  to  be  of  German  Jewish  extraction  .  But  in  the  harsh  world  of  today  's  Wall  Street  they  have  lost  out  to  more  aggressive  and  sometimes  less  scrupulous  successors  .  The  cuckoo  prefers  the  nests  of  other  birds  and  heaves  out  their  eggs  .  But  the  old  guard  hired  the  New  Crowd  people  :  It  brought  in  its  own  cuckoos  .  So  ,  as  the  Old  Crowd  toppled  from  the  branch  ,  it  should  n't  have  been  too  surprised  . 
 The  old  guard  had  every  right  ,  however  ,  to  disdain  the  newcomers  '  new  ways  of  making  money  ,  such  as  greenmail  .  (  A  Fortune  article  on  Saul  Steinberg  was  entitled  ,  ``  Fear  and  Loathing  in  the  Corporate  Boardrooms  .  ''  )  Their  other  staple  has  been  corporate  takeovers  ,  often  hostile  and  financed  by  junk  bonds  .  Hostile  takeovers  are  quite  a  new  phenomenon  .  Sometimes  they  are  constructive  ,  but  often  not  .  First  ,  by  making  management  focus  on  short-term  results  ,  they  inhibit  building  for  the  future  --  just  the  opposite  of  Japan  .  Second  ,  a  long-term  shareholder  of  a  good  company  need  n't  worry  too  much  when  the  stock  price  drops  temporarily  :  It  will  bounce  back  .  But  if  a  raider  takes  over  when  the  stock  is  weak  ,  the  shareholder  never  gets  his  recovery  . 
 The  raiders  ,  meanwhile  ,  have  evolved  their  own  pattern  for  spending  their  new  millions  .  As  described  in  ``  The  New  Crowd  ,  ''  they  take  on  ambitious  new  wives  ,  move  to  Greenwich  ,  Conn.  ,  or  Bedford  ,  N.Y.  ,  buy  OK  pictures  ,  and  let  their  wives  share  the  wealth  with  decorators  .  Having  donated  heavily  to  museums  ,  they  demand  a  place  on  their  boards  . 
 The  book  is  patronizing  about  this  nouveau  riche  struggle  for  respectability  ,  which  has  its  tawdry  aspects  .  However  ,  on  balance  ,  the  charity  game  helps  America  .  If  those  who  have  the  money  do  n't  get  involved  with  the  museums  and  the  charities  ,  then  City  Hall  will  do  it  ,  badly  .  It  has  been  rightly  observed  that  the  main  thing  wrong  with  tainted  money  is  ,  t'  ai  nt  enough  of  it  . 
 A  handful  of  the  New  Crowd  operators  have  crossed  the  line  from  the  immoral  to  the  illegal  ,  and  have  ended  up  in  the  slammer  or  paying  huge  fines  :  Ivan  Boesky  ,  Dennis  Levine  ,  Martin  Siegel  ,  Victor  and  Steven  Posner  ,  and  now  Michael  Milken  and  perhaps  Leona  Helmsley  .  The  glitzy  office  that  Ivan  Boesky  vacated  for  a  prison  cell  had  previously  contained  commodity  operators  Marc  Rich  and  ``  Pinky  ''  Green  ,  today  fugitives  from  a  potential  century  apiece  of  jail  sentences  . 
 The  Old  Crowd  is  deeply  concerned  by  the  backlash  from  all  this  .  However  ,  the  phenomenon  is  not  specifically  Jewish  .  It  has  always  been  true  that  those  outside  the  club  want  to  climb  in  ,  and  that  a  few  will  cut  corners  in  the  process  .  Some  pretty  seamy  stuff  built  the  turn-of-the-century  families  '  Fifth  Avenue  and  Newport  palazzi  and  endowed  their  daughters  '  weddings  to  foreign  noblemen  .  Mr.  Boesky  was  a  piker  compared  to  Jay  Gould  and  Jim  Fiske  ,  and  Commodore  Vanderbilt  thought  nothing  of  bribing  judges  and  legislators  .  So  who  knows  ?  In  a  generation  or  two  some  of  the  New  Crowd  may  attain  true  respectability  ,  perhaps  to  be  displaced  in  turn  by  a  later  flock  of  unscrupulous  raptors  .  Or  perhaps  Wall  Street  ,  when  it  has  suffered  enough  ,  will  realize  that  finance  is  a  service  industry  ,  and  change  its  ethos  . 
 Mr.  Train  is  president  of  Train  ,  Smith  Investment  Counsel  ,  New  York  . 
 Dallas  investor  Harold  C.  Simmons  said  he  raised  his  stake  in  Lockheed  Corp.  to  10.62  %  from  10.43  %  of  the  aerospace  and  electronics  concern  's  common  shares  . 
 In  a  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  filing  ,  Mr.  Simmons  said  he  and  companies  he  controls  ,  NL  Industries  Inc.  and  NL  Chemicals  Inc.  ,  hold  6,744,600  shares  of  Lockheed  ,  of  Calabasas  ,  Calif  .  They  include  122,700  shares  bought  Friday  for  between  $  47.125  and  $  48  each  . 
 In  composite  trading  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  ,  Lockheed  closed  at  $  46.125  a  share  ,  down  12.5  cents  . 
 Earlier  this  week  ,  Mr.  Simmons  objected  to  published  reports  quoting  him  as  saying  he  planned  to  sell  his  Lockheed  stake  because  ``  the  defense  industry  seems  to  be  getting  more  uncertain  .  '' 
 Valhi  Inc.  ,  another  of  Mr.  Simmons  '  companies  ,  responded  to  an  article  Monday  in  The  Wall  Street  Journal  ,  which  credited  a  story  in  the  Sunday  Los  Angeles  Daily  News  .  Valhi  said  the  articles  did  n't  accurately  reflect  Valhi  and  its  affiliates  '  intentions  toward  Lockheed  .  Instead  ,  Valhi  said  ,  they  may  increase  ,  decrease  or  retain  their  Lockheed  holdings  ,  depending  on  a  number  of  conditions  . 
 Canada  ,  which  is  preparing  to  speed  up  tariff  cuts  with  the  U.S.  ,  recorded  a  47  %  narrowing  in  its  trade  surplus  with  the  U.S.  in  August  ,  Statistics  Canada  ,  a  federal  agency  ,  reported  . 
 U.S.  exports  to  Canada  jumped  11.2  %  in  August  from  July  while  U.S.  imports  from  Canada  rose  only  2.7  %  .  As  a  result  ,  Canada  's  trade  surplus  with  the  U.S.  narrowed  to  C$  656.5  million  (  US$  558  million  )  in  August  from  C$  1.23  billion  (  US$  1.04  billion  )  in  July  . 
 U.S.  exports  benefited  in  August  from  heavy  Canadian  spending  on  new  plant  and  equipment  and  a  pickup  in  Canadian  auto  demand  ,  Canadian  officials  said  . 
 The  U.S.  and  Canada  ,  which  do  more  trade  than  any  other  pair  of  nations  ,  are  to  meet  next  month  to  arrange  an  acceleration  of  planned  tariff  cuts  under  the  U.S.-Canada  free  trade  agreement  . 
 Industries  in  both  countries  have  requested  a  speedup  of  tariff  cuts  on  hundreds  of  products  .  Some  tariffs  were  eliminated  when  the  trade  pact  took  effect  Jan.  1  .  The  remainder  were  to  be  phased  out  in  five  or  10  annual  installments  ,  with  all  tariffs  eliminated  by  January  1998  . 
 The  two  countries  aim  to  reach  an  agreement  by  early  December  on  a  package  of  accelerated  tariff  cuts  that  would  take  effect  early  next  year  . 
 Canadian  officials  said  the  trade  pact  has  kindled  an  export  interest  among  many  small  Canadian  companies  that  previously  had  little  or  no  foreign  sales  . 
 For  such  businessmen  ,  the  Canadian  government  is  organizing  55  missions  this  year  to  U.S.  states  bordering  on  Canada  .  The  businessmen  are  introduced  to  potential  agents  and  distributors  and  instructed  in  trade  procedures  .  The  U.S.  Commerce  Department  is  planning  to  try  out  similar  trips  on  U.S.  businessmen  in  coming  months  under  its  Canada  First  !  Outreach  Program  .  Participants  in  the  U.S.  missions  to  Canada  are  to  be  assisted  by  members  of  the  Service  Corps  of  Retired  Executives  ,  a  volunteer  group  ,  in  dealing  with  their  export  challenges  . 
 The  Canadian  government  also  has  recently  opened  new  trade  offices  in  San  Diego  ;  San  Juan  ,  Puerto  Rico  ;  Miami  ;  Princeton  ,  N.J.  ,  and  Denver  ,  bringing  the  total  number  of  such  Canadian  offices  in  the  U.S.  to  27  .  The  U.S.  has  six  trade  promotion  offices  in  Canada  . 
 Canada  's  export  effort  has  been  blunted  by  robust  home  market  demand  and  by  an  18  %  appreciation  of  the  Canadian  dollar  against  its  U.S.  counterpart  in  the  past  three  years  that  has  made  Canadian  goods  more  costly  in  the  U.S  . 
 Canada  's  trade  surplus  with  all  countries  narrowed  to  C$  203.5  million  in  August  from  C$  528.3  million  in  July  ,  Statistics  Canada  said  . 
 Loral  Corp.  said  it  received  a  $  325  million  order  from  Turkey  's  Ministry  of  Defense  ,  the  largest  contract  the  company  ever  has  received  . 
 Loral  will  provide  to  Turkey  an  electronic  countermeasures  system  for  its  fleet  of  F-16  aircraft  .  The  system  provides  radar-threat  warning  and  electronic  jamming  capabilities  . 
 The  defense  electronics  maker  said  delivery  will  begin  in  October  1991  and  run  through  mid-1995  .  Loral  said  the  contract  with  Turkey  will  provide  opportunities  for  Loral  to  supply  that  country  with  other  defense  systems  . 
 Crown  Resources  Corp.  said  it  reached  a  definitive  agreement  to  acquire  the  Gold  Texas  Resources  Ltd.  shares  it  does  n't  already  own  . 
 Under  the  proposed  agreement  ,  Gold  Texas  holders  will  receive  1.43  Crown  shares  for  each  of  the  1.1  million  Gold  Texas  shares  not  owned  by  Crown  ,  which  already  owns  65  %  . 
 The  arrangement  is  subject  to  approval  by  the  Supreme  Court  of  British  Columbia  province  ,  Crown  said  .  Gold  Texas  is  based  in  Vancouver  ,  British  Columbia  ,  and  Crown  Resources  is  based  in  Denver  .  Both  are  mining  concerns  . 
 Apogee  Robotics  Inc.  said  its  board  extended  until  Feb.  1  the  exercise  period  of  Apogee  's  existing  stock  purchase  warrants  outstanding  .  The  expiration  date  had  been  Nov.  3  . 
 Each  of  the  1,075,000  warrants  entitle  the  holders  to  purchase  one  share  of  Apogee  common  stock  for  $  2.25  .  Apogee  was  quoted  in  the  over-the-counter  market  yesterday  at  $  2  bid  . 
 Bank  of  New  England  Corp.  ,  seeking  to  streamline  its  business  after  a  year  of  weak  earnings  and  mounting  loan  problems  ,  said  it  will  sell  some  operations  and  lay  off  4  %  of  its  work  force  . 
 The  bank  holding  company  also  reported  that  third-quarter  profit  dropped  41  %  ,  to  $  42.7  million  ,  or  61  cents  a  share  ,  from  the  year-earlier  $  72.3  million  ,  or  $  1.04  a  share  . 
 Among  its  restructuring  measures  ,  the  company  said  it  plans  to  sell  53  of  its  453  branch  offices  and  to  lay  off  800  employees  .  Altogether  ,  employment  is  expected  to  decline  to  less  than  16,000  from  the  current  level  of  about  18,000  . 
 Walter  Connolly  ,  chairman  ,  said  in  an  interview  that  the  company  expects  to  record  pretax  gains  of  $  100  million  to  $  125  million  from  the  sale  of  its  leasing  operations  and  of  certain  financial  processing  services  .  In  a  prepared  statement  ,  the  company  said  it  expects  to  realize  those  gains  before  year  end  . 
 Nonperforming  assets  continued  to  pile  up  in  the  latest  quarter  ,  rising  to  $  900  million  ,  or  3.52  %  of  loans  and  leases  ,  from  $  667  million  ,  or  2.68  %  ,  at  the  end  of  the  second  quarter  .  Some  $  170  million  of  the  $  233  million  increase  in  nonperforming  loans  was  related  to  real  estate  ,  and  roughly  three-quarters  of  that  was  in  the  troubled  New  England  market  ,  according  to  Richard  Driscoll  ,  vice  chairman  . 
 Mr.  Driscoll  said  that  ,  despite  continued  weakness  in  the  region  's  real  estate  market  ,  Bank  of  New  England  expects  the  rate  of  increase  in  nonperforming  assets  to  slow  in  coming  quarters  .  Mr.  Connolly  noted  that  net  third-quarter  charge-offs  ,  at  $  63  million  ,  improved  slightly  from  the  $  67  million  in  the  second  quarter  .  And  he  indicated  that  more  substantial  improvement  is  expected  in  the  next  couple  of  quarters  . 
 The  company  increased  its  loan  loss  reserve  to  $  354  million  from  $  342  million  at  the  end  of  the  second  quarter  .  Total  assets  slipped  to  $  31.4  billion  ,  from  $  32  billion  as  of  June  30  . 
 Among  other  restructuring  measures  ,  the  bank  said  it  will  close  its  loan  production  offices  in  Chicago  ,  New  York  and  Philadelphia  .  The  Chicago  office  figured  prominently  in  the  bank  's  problems  earlier  this  year  ,  when  $  65  million  in  loans  to  Chicago  businessman  William  Stoecker  went  sour  . 
 In  an  internal  memorandum  to  employees  ,  Messrs.  Connolly  and  Driscoll  described  the  restructuring  as  an  effort  to  continue  rationalizing  operations  assembled  during  a  series  of  mergers  over  the  past  five  years  . 
 Italy  's  wholesale  price  index  rose  0.4  %  in  August  from  July  and  was  up  6.1  %  from  a  year  earlier  ,  the  state  statistical  institute  reported  . 
 The  index  registered  196.1  in  August  ,  compared  with  195.4  in  July  and  with  184.9  in  August  1988  . 
 The  year-on-year  rise  in  August  was  slightly  down  from  the  6.4  %  rate  in  July  . 
 The  index  has  a  base  of  100  set  in  1980  and  is  n't  seasonally  adjusted  . 
 U.S.  steel  imports  in  August  fell  14  %  from  a  year  earlier  to  1,531,000  tons  ,  according  to  the  American  Iron  and  Steel  Institute  . 
 The  trade  group  's  compilation  of  Commerce  Department  data  showed  that  August  imports  ,  the  second  largest  monthly  total  of  the  year  ,  were  up  5  %  from  July  's  1,458,000  tons  but  below  last  year  's  high  of  1,979,000  tons  in  June  1988  . 
 August  imports  claimed  18.5  %  of  the  U.S.  market  ,  compared  with  19.3  %  in  July  and  20.5  %  in  August  1988  .  The  latest  month  's  figures  show  that  imports  of  steel  from  European  Community  nations  fell  to  466,000  tons  from  481,000  a  month  earlier  ,  while  imports  from  Japan  rose  to  323,000  tons  from  288,000  in  July  .  Imports  from  Canada  rose  to  272,000  tons  in  August  from  209,000  in  July  . 
 The  American  Institute  for  Imported  Steel  said  imports  for  the  first  eight  months  of  1989  were  below  the  level  allowed  by  the  Voluntary  Restraint  Agreement  program  .  The  institute  said  that  ,  excluding  semifinished  steel  products  ,  year-to-date  imports  represented  15.2  %  of  consumption  ,  compared  with  a  permitted  maximum  of  18.5  %  . 
 Japanese  machinery  makers  received  orders  totaling  1.465  trillion  yen  (  $  10.33  billion  )  in  August  ,  up  14  %  from  a  year  earlier  ,  the  Economic  Planning  Agency  said  . 
 ``  Equipment  orders  on  the  domestic  side  were  particularly  strong  in  shipping  and  power  utilities  ,  ''  said  an  agency  official  . 
 The  latest  report  compares  with  a  modest  9.9  %  increase  in  July  machinery  orders  from  a  year  earlier  . 
 In  August  ,  soon  after  Wang  Laboratories  Inc.  reported  a  staggering  $  424.3  million  loss  and  replaced  its  president  ,  two  Boston  sales  representatives  sent  customers  a  letter  saying  :  ``  We  fully  expect  that  you  will  soon  be  reading  stories  in  the  press  reporting  the  `  Amazing  Comeback  at  Wang  .  '  '' 
 How  soon  Wang  will  stage  a  comeback  ,  or  if  it  will  at  all  ,  are  still  matters  of  debate  .  But  Wang  salespeople  are  trying  to  cope  with  the  biggest  challenge  any  marketer  can  face  :  selling  the  products  of  a  company  that  is  on  the  ropes  . 
 ``  If  your  prospect  is  feeling  risk  the  whole  time  and  you  're  not  feeling  as  if  you  're  backed  up  by  a  stable  company  ,  you  've  lost  it  before  you  've  begun  ,  ''  says  Mary  Ann  Cluggish  ,  a  Wellesley  ,  Mass.  ,  sales  trainer  and  consultant  who  works  with  high  technology  companies  . 
 It  can  happen  in  any  industry  .  Consider  the  difficulties  faced  by  Audi  salespeople  when  the  car  was  tainted  by  false  charges  of  sudden  acceleration  ,  or  Exxon  dealers  '  problems  in  the  wake  of  the  Valdez  oil  spill  . 
 Like  thousands  of  salespeople  before  them  ,  Wang  's  are  finding  ways  to  combat  the  bad  news  .  ``  It  's  very  important  that  we  exude  confidence  ,  even  though  within  the  family  we  know  there  's  a  lot  of  hard  work  ahead  ,  ''  said  Richard  Miller  ,  the  Lowell  ,  Mass.  ,  computer  concern  's  new  president  ,  in  a  video  message  to  salespeople  a  month  after  he  took  over  . 
 Wang  got  into  financial  trouble  because  of  bloated  overhead  and  overly  optimistic  sales  forecasts  .  Its  mainline  minicomputers  and  word  processors  have  lost  ground  to  cheaper  personal  computers  .  Last  year  it  funded  its  high  employment  by  heavy  borrowing  ,  and  it  suffered  huge  losses  when  sales  turned  down  instead  of  rising  . 
 After  the  company  reported  red  ink  for  the  fiscal  third  quarter  ,  Wang  's  marketing  department  provided  the  sales  force  answers  to  questions  such  as  ``  How  could  you  not  have  known  you  were  going  to  lose  $  55  million  ?  ''  and  ``  Is  Wang  still  a  viable  company  ?  '' 
 Salespeople  try  to  push  their  products  and  avoid  discussions  of  finances  .  Responding  to  such  questions  is  ``  defensive  ,  ''  says  Kenneth  Olissa  ,  Wang  's  vice  president  ,  marketing  .  ``  That  's  antithetical  to  the  art  of  selling  .  ''  Moreover  ,  he  notes  that  analyzing  financial  results  ``  poses  a  problem  for  a  salesman  who  is  n't  particularly  familiar  with  a  balance  sheet  .  '' 
 At  one  sales  strategy  meeting  ,  an  executive  suggested  ordering  salespeople  to  become  experts  on  the  annual  report  .  Mr.  Miller  vetoed  that  :  ``  Even  I  ca  n't  understand  all  the  footnotes  ,  ''  he  says  .  Instead  ,  he  says  ,  if  the  salespeople  can  get  the  customers  to  consider  Wang  's  products  on  their  merits  ,  he  or  a  top  financial  officer  will  try  to  assuage  the  fears  about  finances  . 
 Mike  Metschan  ,  a  salesman  in  Wang  's  Austin  ,  Texas  ,  office  ,  has  a  breezier  method  :  ``  We  tell  them  $  3  billion  companies  do  n't  go  out  of  business  .  We  tell  them  all  the  major  companies  are  having  financial  difficulties  .  ''  Numerous  computer  companies  are  having  sales  slumps  and  earnings  declines  ,  but  very  few  have  had  losses  comparable  to  Wang  's  or  are  carrying  such  a  large  debt  load  . 
 Mr.  Miller  says  that  after  a  sharp  sales  slump  in  July  and  August  ,  sales  stabilized  in  September  .  Although  Wang  will  report  a  loss  for  the  first  quarter  ended  Sept.  30  and  the  full  fiscal  year  ,  Mr.  Miller  says  he  expects  the  company  will  return  to  profitability  by  the  fourth  quarter  . 
 Experts  on  sales  technique  say  anyone  representing  a  troubled  company  must  walk  a  fine  line  .  ``  If  a  salesman  jeopardizes  his  credibility  in  this  time  of  trouble  ,  it  will  be  a  problem  for  the  long  run  ,  ''  says  George  Palmatier  ,  a  Minden  ,  Nev.  ,  sales  consultant  and  author  of  ``  The  Marketing  Edge  .  '' 
 Still  ,  says  John  Sullivan  ,  a  management  recruiter  with  Daniel  Roberts  Inc.  of  Boston  ,  who  has  held  senior  sales  positions  at  Polaroid  and  Atari  :  ``  The  customer  will  react  to  strength  .  Ignore  the  present  condition  .  Show  it  's  business  as  usual  .  '' 
 That  is  n't  easy  .  Wang  's  customers  are  data  processing  managers  who  want  to  be  sure  that  their  suppliers  are  stable  ,  wellrun  companies  that  will  be  around  to  fix  bugs  and  upgrade  computers  for  years  to  come  . 
 For  buyers  ,  ``  these  are  career-risking  decisions  ,  ''  says  Jean  Conlin  ,  who  supervises  a  network  of  Wang  computers  in  the  admissions  department  at  Boston  University  .  The  university  is  considering  installing  a  $  250,000  system  to  store  applications  electronically  .  ``  Before  the  really  bad  news  ,  we  were  looking  at  Wang  fairly  seriously  ,  ''  she  says  .  But  ``  their  present  financial  condition  means  I  'd  have  a  hard  time  convincing  the  vice  president  in  charge  of  purchasing  .  '' 
 Ms.  Conlin  adds  :  ``  At  some  point  we  'd  have  to  ask  ,  `  How  do  we  know  that  in  three  years  you  wo  n't  be  in  Chapter  11  ?  '  '' 
 During  the  past  year  ,  Wang  has  developed  new  products  and  a  new  strategy  and  hired  a  new  president  .  Wang  's  overall  product  line  is  ``  still  not  as  good  as  other  vendors  ,  but  they  've  come  a  long  way  ,  ''  says  Steven  Wendler  ,  a  consultant  with  market  researcher  Gartner  Group  ,  Stamford  ,  Conn  .  ``  They  were  on  the  road  to  recovery  in  terms  of  customer  attitudes  until  this  bad  quarter  happened  .  '' 
 The  first  priority  for  Wang  's  sales  force  is  to  make  sure  it  holds  on  to  existing  customers  .  Wang  's  installed  base  is  one  of  its  greatest  assets  ,  and  many  of  those  customers  remain  extremely  loyal  . 
 But  even  before  Wang  's  latest  financial  troubles  surfaced  ,  some  customers  ``  were  trying  to  wall  off  their  Wang  installations  ''  so  other  departments  would  n't  add  Wang  ,  says  Chris  Christiansen  ,  a  former  Wang  marketer  who  is  now  a  market  analyst  with  Meta  Group  ,  a  market  research  firm  in  Stamford  ,  Conn  . 
 One  Wang  salesman  who  left  the  company  in  July  recalls  that  when  he  tried  to  sell  products  to  Eastman  Kodak  ,  he  worked  ``  to  muster  support  from  internal  allies  ,  ''  but  ``  those  allies  became  skeptical  as  they  saw  the  downtrend  .  The  more  recent  losses  were  really  devastating  .  '' 
 New  customers  ,  the  source  of  higher  commissions  for  salespeople  and  the  key  to  Wang  's  long-term  viability  ,  are  even  tougher  .  Rick  Lynch  ,  a  former  top  salesman  in  Wang  's  Boston  office  ,  referring  to  Wang  's  mainstay  computer  line  ,  says  :  ``  You  ca  n't  sell  a  VS  to  a  new  customer  .  ''  Mr.  Lynch  left  Wang  this  summer  for  Oracle  Systems  Inc.  ,  a  software  vendor  . 
 The  financial  problems  are  particularly  frustrating  for  salespeople  pushing  Wang  's  image  systems  ,  which  convert  paper  forms  to  electronic  documents  .  Consultants  say  that  Wang  's  technology  is  among  the  best  available  in  the  image  market  . 
 But  salespeople  often  found  that  news  of  Wang  's  problems  superseded  their  sales  efforts  .  William  Tait  ,  a  former  sales  manager  in  Indianapolis  ,  says  that  his  office  had  all  but  sold  a  $  1.5  million  image  system  to  pharmaceutical  maker  Eli  Lilly  &  Co  .  ``  When  they  were  making  the  decision  ,  all  hell  broke  loose  with  the  finances  .  ''  He  says  the  Lilly  executives  told  him  they  could  n't  take  the  risk  with  Wang  . 
 Mr.  Tait  say  he  does  n't  blame  Lilly  .  Buyers  have  to  rely  on  a  supplier  ``  continually  upgrading  and  replacing  the  product  ,  ''  he  says  .  ``  When  a  company  realizes  that  ,  it  's  hard  to  go  with  Wang  .  ''  For  Mr.  Tait  ,  who  says  he  used  to  earn  as  much  as  $  150,000  a  year  at  Wang  ,  it  was  one  more  reason  to  quit  .  He  is  now  president  of  Eastate  Homes  Inc.  ,  an  Indianapolis  contractor  . 
 It  can  be  hard  for  a  salesperson  to  fight  off  feelings  of  discouragement  .  Brian  Petre  ,  a  former  Wang  salesman  in  upstate  New  York  ,  says  :  ``  You  have  pride  in  your  job  .  You  think  you  can  go  out  and  turn  things  around  .  It  's  a  tough  thing  when  you  ca  n't  .  The  reason  does  n't  relate  to  your  selling  skills  .  '' 
 Discouragement  feeds  on  itself  .  ``  The  problem  is  ,  if  people  get  down  in  the  dumps  ,  they  stop  selling  ,  ''  says  Mike  Durcan  ,  a  laid-off  sales  manager  in  Wang  's  Austin  office  . 
 One  key  for  salespeople  is  to  boost  their  own  morale  .  Paul  Hellman  ,  a  Framingham  ,  Mass.  ,  sales  and  management  consultant  and  author  of  ``  Ready  ,  Aim  ,  You  're  Hired  ,  ''  says  :  ``  The  bad  news  is  ,  you  'll  be  rejected  more  .  The  good  news  is  ,  it  's  not  your  fault  .  ''  So  ,  he  advises  ,  make  goals  achievable  .  For  instance  ,  he  suggests  that  salespeople  making  telephone  calls  should  say  to  themselves  :  ``  All  I  want  to  do  today  is  get  50  rejections  .  '' 
 But  Mr.  Miller  ,  Wang  's  new  president  ,  recently  warned  his  salespeople  about  negativism  .  ``  Our  customers  watch  us  for  the  hidden  message  ,  ''  he  said  .  ``  Look  a  customer  right  in  the  eye  and  say  ,  `  I  'm  glad  to  be  at  Wang  .  '  '' 

 Blinder  International  Enterprises  Inc.  ,  the  parent  of  beleaguered  penny-stockbroker  Blinder  ,  Robinson  &  Co.  ,  said  its  shareholders  approved  a  previously  announced  name  change  to  Intercontinental  Enterprises  Inc  . 
 ``  The  parent  company  is  diversifying  into  other  industries  around  the  world  ,  ''  said  president  Meyer  Blinder  in  explaining  the  name  change  .  ``  Everytime  we  talked  about  Blinder  International  ,  {  people  }  thought  it  was  the  brokerage  house  .  ''  Mr.  Blinder  said  the  change  was  n't  related  to  the  brokerage  's  recent  troubles  ,  which  have  included  sharp  declines  in  earnings  ,  run-ins  with  the  securities  regulators  and  lawsuits  by  former  customers  . 
 The  company  said  it  expects  the  name  change  to  take  effect  within  a  week  . 
 Olin  Corp.  said  third-quarter  net  income  rose  26  %  on  the  strength  of  its  chemical  business  . 
 Net  was  $  24  million  ,  or  $  1.15  a  share  ,  up  from  $  19  million  ,  or  90  cents  a  share  ,  a  year  earlier  .  Sales  rose  7.4  %  to  $  580  million  from  $  540  million  . 
 Olin  said  its  chemical  segment  had  profit  of  $  22  million  ,  up  from  $  15  million  a  year  ago  ,  largely  because  of  gains  in  electrochemicals  such  as  caustic  soda  .  The  company  said  the  gains  were  tied  to  volume  increases  and  higher  prices  .  The  market  for  electrochemicals  include  the  paper  ,  water-purification  and  textile  industries  . 
 The  chemical  segment  had  a  $  6  million  gain  on  the  sale  of  ammonia  and  urea  businesses  ,  which  was  offset  by  a  $  6  million  charge  for  future  environmental  expenditures  .  Profit  in  Olin  's  defense  and  ammunition  segment  rose  to  $  8  million  from  $  7  million  .  The  metals  segment  ,  hurt  by  a  strike  ,  had  break-even  results  ,  against  $  3  million  a  year  ago  . 
 In  the  first  nine  months  ,  net  rose  21  %  to  $  93  million  ,  or  $  4.52  a  share  ,  from  $  77  million  ,  or  $  3.62  a  share  a  year  ago  .  Sales  rose  13  %  to  $  1.91  billion  from  $  1.69  billion  . 
 In  New  York  Stock  Exchange  composite  trading  ,  Olin  closed  at  $  58.50  a  share  ,  down  25  cents  . 
 GTE  Corp.  and  MCI  Communications  Corp.  reported  strong  earnings  gains  to  record  levels  for  the  third  quarter  .  Southwestern  Bell  Corp.  and  Cincinnati  Bell  posted  slight  declines  . 
 GTE  Corp  . 
 GTE  said  net  income  rose  18  %  ,  aided  by  higher  long-distance  calling  volumes  and  an  increase  in  telephone  lines  in  service  .  Pretax  operating  profit  from  telephone  operations  rose  8.2  %  but  profits  from  telecommunications  products  and  electrical  products  were  flat  . 
 Revenues  rose  8.8  %  to  $  4.35  billion  from  $  4.0  billion  . 
 The  company  said  the  quarter  included  a  10  %  increase  in  local-exchange  usage  for  long-distance  calling  and  a  5  %  increase  in  the  number  of  access  lines  in  service  .  Earlier  rate  reductions  in  Texas  and  California  reduced  the  quarter  's  revenue  and  operating  profit  $  55  million  ;  a  year  earlier  ,  operating  profit  in  telephone  operations  was  reduced  by  a  similar  amount  as  a  result  of  a  provision  for  a  reorganization  . 
 Revenue  in  the  telecommunications  products  and  services  unit  rose  27  %  to  $  728.8  million  ,  but  operating  profit  was  unchanged  at  $  26.3  million  ,  partly  because  of  start-up  expenses  .  Electrical  products  '  sales  fell  to  $  496.7  million  from  $  504.5  million  with  higher  world-wide  lighting  volume  offset  by  lower  domestic  prices  and  the  impact  of  weaker  currencies  in  Europe  and  South  America  .  Operating  profit  of  $  37.2  million  was  unchanged  . 
 In  composite  trading  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  ,  GTE  rose  $  1.25  to  $  64.125  .  MCI  Communications  Corp  . 
 MCI  ,  which  stepped  up  efforts  to  sell  long-distance  telephone  service  to  residential  customers  ,  reported  a  59  %  jump  in  earnings  .  Revenue  rose  23  %  to  $  1.67  billion  from  $  1.36  billion  . 
 Operating  profit  grew  57  %  to  $  269  million  from  $  171  million  ,  while  operating  margins  rose  to  16.1  %  from  15.9  %  the  previous  quarter  and  12.6  %  a  year  ago  .  Daniel  Akerson  ,  MCI  chief  financial  officer  ,  said  the  company  sees  further  improvements  in  operating  margins  .  ``  We  think  we  can  take  it  to  the  18  %  range  over  next  18  to  24  months  ,  ''  he  said  . 
 In  national  over-the-counter  trading  ,  MCI  fell  $  2.625  to  $  42.375  .  Charles  Schellke  ,  an  analyst  with  Smith  Barney  ,  Harris  Upham  &  Co.  ,  said  some  investors  apparently  expected  slightly  better  revenue  growth  . 
 The  company  said  that  residential  traffic  grew  faster  than  business  traffic  and  attributed  that  to  its  new  PrimeTime  calling  plan  that  competes  with  American  Telephone  &  Telegraph  's  Reach  Out  America  plan  .  MCI  claims  about  12  %  of  the  overall  long-distance  telephone  market  but  just  under  10  %  of  the  $  23  billion  residential  market  .  It  has  been  trying  to  improve  its  share  of  the  residential  market  .  The  company  wants  its  business  mix  to  more  closely  match  that  of  AT&T  --  a  step  it  says  will  help  prevent  cross  subsidization  . 
 Mr.  Akerson  said  MCI  recorded  ``  another  solid  cash  positive  quarter  ,  ''  its  fourth  in  a  row  ,  but  declined  to  comment  on  whether  the  company  is  considering  a  dividend  or  is  planning  any  acquisition  .  The  current  quarter  ,  he  said  ,  ``  looks  fine  .  We  think  revenue  will  continue  to  grow  and  that  we  can  control  costs  and  thus  improve  profitability  .  '' 
 Southwestern  Bell  Corp  . 
 Southwestern  Bell  Corp.  said  net  dropped  8.7  %  ,  mainly  the  result  of  four  extraordinary  items  :  a  franchise  tax  refund  that  its  Southwestern  Bell  Telephone  Co.  unit  received  last  year  ;  a  production  shift  of  several  Yellow  Pages  directories  to  the  fourth  quarter  from  the  third  ;  a  rate  refund  in  Missouri  and  a  one-time  adjustment  to  phone  company  revenues  . 
 Revenue  slipped  1.2  %  to  $  2.21  billion  from  $  2.23  billion  . 
 The  earnings  drop  had  been  expected  .  Chairman  Zane  E.  Barnes  said  Southwestern  Bell  's  ``  businesses  are  healthy  and  are  continuing  to  grow  .  '' 
 The  company  reported  a  3.1  %  increase  in  the  number  of  access  lines  in  service  ,  and  also  said  its  Southwestern  Bell  Mobile  Systems  unit  added  30,000  new  customers  ,  with  a  current  total  of  about  333,000  . 
 Southwestern  shares  fell  50  cents  to  $  55.875  in  composite  trading  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  . 
 Cincinnati  Bell  Inc  . 
 Cincinnati  Bell  Inc.  said  net  declined  1.8  %  .  The  company  noted  that  the  year-ago  period  was  particularly  strong  ,  with  an  increase  of  nearly  70  %  .  Revenue  jumped  nearly  17  %  to  $  223.3  million  from  $  191.4  million  .  In  composite  trading  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  ,  Cincinnati  Bell  fell  25  cents  to  $  29  . 
 The  company  said  that  the  number  of  access  lines  dropped  slightly  in  the  quarter  ,  a  decline  attributed  to  seasonal  fluctuations  .  For  the  year  ,  however  ,  access  lines  in  service  have  increased  5.5  %  . 
 Chairman  D.H.  Hibbard  said  the  company  has  set  a  new  five  year  goal  of  doubling  revenues  to  about  $  1.8  billion  while  steadily  increasing  net  .
